            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FInding Encouragement for a new Edition of the <hi>Ladies Travels,</hi> as I had juſt Reaſon from your Merits before, to dedicate a part of them to you, ſo the Continuation of your particular Favours makes me take this Opportunity to acknowledge them, and now to Addreſs the Whole.

Your Great Skill in that Excellent Art, which with ſo much Life and Pleaſure repreſents the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, beſides your other extraordinary
<pb facs="tcp:151523:3"/> Qualifications, endears you to them, and I hope will influence them to help me off with this Impreſſion.

            <div n="1" type="letter">
               <head>LETTER. I.</head>
               <p>SEEING you are ſo earneſt with me to let you know all my Adventures and whatſoever I have obſerv'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Travels, you muſt therefore be contented (my dear Couſin) to bear with a great many trifling Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, before you can meet with what will pleaſe you: I know your fancy is ſo nice and delicate, that none but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Accidents can entertain you; and I wiſh I had no others to relate: but recounting things faithfully, as they have hapned, you muſt be contented therewith.</p>
               <p>I gave you an Account in my laſt, of what I met with as far as <hi>Bayonne:</hi> you know this is a Town in <hi>France,</hi> Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to <hi>Spain,</hi> waſh'd by the Rivers <hi>Dadour</hi> and <hi>Nivelle,</hi> which joyn together; and the Sea comes up to them. The Port and Trade are conſiderable: I came from <hi>Axe</hi> by Water, and obſerv'd that the Boat-men of <hi>Adour</hi> have the ſame Cuſtom as thoſe of <hi>Caronne;</hi> which is to ſay, That in paſſing by one another, they ſet up a Hollowing; and they had rather loſe their Wages than to forbear theſe ſort of Shoutings, although exceeding vexatious to thoſe who are not uſed to them. There
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151523:4"/> are two Caſtles ſtrong enough to defend the Town, and there are about it ſeveral pleaſant Walks.</p>
               <p>At my Arrival there, I intreated the Baron <hi>de Castlenau,</hi> who had accompany'd me from <hi>Axe,</hi> to bring me acquainted with ſome Women, with whom I might ſpend my time with leſs impatience, till the Litters came, which were to be ſent to me from St. <hi>Sebastian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He readily complied with my Requeſt: for being a Perſon of Quality and Worth, he is much eſteem'd at <hi>Bayonne.</hi> He fail'd not the next Morning to bring ſeveral Ladies to viſit me.</p>
               <p>Theſe Women begin here to feel the ſcorching Heats of the Sun; their Complexion is dark, their Eyes ſparkling; they are charming enough, their Wits are ſharp: And I could give you a farther Account of their Capacities, could I have better underſtood what they ſaid: not but that they could all ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> yet with ſuch a different Dialect, as ſurpaſt my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Some who came to ſee me, brought little ſucking Pigs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Arms, as we do little Dogs: it's true they were very ſpruce, and ſeveral of 'em had Collars of Ribbons, of various Colours: However, this Cuſtom looks very odd, and I cannot but think that ſeveral among themſelves are diſguſted at it: When they danced, they muſt ſet them down, and let theſe grunting Animals run about the Chamber, where they make a very pleaſant Harmony. Theſe Ladies danc'd at my Intreaty, the Baron of <hi>Castleneau</hi> having ſent for Pipes and Tabors.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen who attended the Ladies, took each of 'em her whom he had brought with him, and the Dance began in a Round, all holding Hands: they had afterwards long Canes brought them, and then each Spark taking hold of the Lady's Handkerchief, which ſeparated them from one another, moved very gracefully at the Sound of this Martial ſort of Muſick, which inſpired them with ſuch Heat, that they ſeem'd not to be able to moderate it. This ſeem'd to me to reſemble the <hi>Pyrric</hi> Dance ſo much celebrated by the Ancients; for theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Ladies made ſo many Turns, Frisks and Capers, their Canes being thrown up into the Air, and dexterouſly caught again, that it is impoſſible to deſcribe their Art and Agility: And I had a great deal of Pleaſure in ſeeing 'em; but methoughts it laſted too long, and I began to grow weary of this ill-ordered Ball<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the Baron <hi>de Caſtleneau,</hi> who perceiv'd it, cauſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Baskets of dried Fruit to be brought in. They are the <hi>Jews</hi> who paſt for <hi>Portuguiſes,</hi> and dwell at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> who tranſport them from <hi>Geroa,</hi> and furniſh all the Country with them. We
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151523:4"/> wanted not for <hi>Limonade,</hi> and other refreſhing Waters, of which theſe Ladies drank heartily; and ſo the Entertainment ended.</p>
               <p>I was carry'd the next Morning to ſee the Synagogue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Suburb of the Holy Spirit, but met with nothing remarkable there. Monſieur <hi>de St. Pe,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant, who came to ſee me, though much troubled with the Gout, invited me to Dine at his Houſe, where I was moſt deliciouſly entertain'd; for this is a Country abounding with good Cheer, and at cheap Rates. I found here Women of Quality, that were very handſome, whom he had invited to bear me Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The ſight of the Caſtle, which faces the River, is very pleaſant, and has always a good Garriſon in it.</p>
               <p>At my return to my Lodging, I was ſurpriz'd to find ſeveral Pieces of Linnen, which were brought to me from the Ladies who came to ſee me, with Baskets full of dried Sweet-meats. This Treatment ſeem'd to me very obliging, to a Lady whom they had not known above four or five Days. But I muſt not forget to tell you, there is not any finer Linnen in the World than that which is made in this Country, ſome of which is open like Net-work, and the Threads of it finer than Hair: And I remember, that travelling thro' the Villages of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which may be rather call'd Deſarts, the poor Peaſants living ſo wretchedly; yet I found among them as neat Napkins as thoſe uſed amongſt People of Quality at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I fail'd not to ſend theſe Ladies ſuch little Preſents which I thought might pleaſe them: I perceiv'd they were great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of Ribbons, and wear a great many on their Heads and Ears, which made me ſend them a great many; to which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeveral Fans: and they, by way of Return, preſented me with Gloves, and Thread-Stockins, moſt delicately knit.</p>
               <p>In ſending them to me, they deſired me to go to the next Chappel, which was not far from my Quarters, where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Regale me with the beſt Muſick the Town would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford but though there were very good Voices, yet there is no great pleaſure in hearing them, becauſe they want both Air and Skill.</p>
               <p>The Litters which I expected from <hi>Spain,</hi> being come, I prepared for my Departure; but I never met any thing dearer than theſe ſort of Equipages; for each Litter has a Maſter that accompanies it, who keeps the Gravity of a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, being mounted on a Mule, and his Man on another, with which they releaſe ever and anon thoſe that carry the Litter. I had two, I took the greateſt for my ſelf and my Child, and had beſides four Mules for my Servants, and two others for my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151523:5"/> Baggage: to conduct them, there were other two Maſters and two Men. You ſee what Charge one is at, to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſeeing you muſt pay not only for their Attendance on you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but the ſame Price for their return back: However, we muſt ſubmit to their Cuſtoms, and ſuffer our ſelves to be peel'd by them.</p>
               <p>I found at <hi>Bayonne</hi> ſeveral <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mores,</hi> and I think a worſe ſort of People, and theſe are Cuſtom-Houſe-Men: I had cauſed my Trunks to be weigh'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> that I might have the leſs to do with theſe ſort of People; but they were more ſubtle, or to ſpeak better, more obſtinate than I; ſo that I was forc'd to give them whatſoever they demanded. Scarcely was I got clear from them, when the Drums, Trumpets, Pipes, and Violins of the Town, came thundring upon me; they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me farther than St. <hi>Anthony's</hi> Gate, through which you paſs for <hi>Spain</hi> through <hi>Biſcaye:</hi> they play'd each of them in their way, and all together without any Harmony, which was enough to drive any one out of their Senſes: I ordered ſome Money to be given them, upon which they left perſecuting me. As ſoon as we had left <hi>Bayonne,</hi> we enter'd into a large bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Heath, where we ſaw nothing but Cheſnut-Trees; but we afterwards paſt along by the Sea, whoſe Sand makes a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, and a pleaſant Proſpect.</p>
               <p>We arriv'd in good time at St. <hi>John de Luz:</hi> nothing can be pleaſanter than this Borough, which is the greateſt in <hi>France,</hi> and the beſt built; there are ſeveral ſmaller Cities: its Port lies between two Mountains, which Nature ſeems to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly placed to defend it from Storms; the River <hi>Nivelle</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorges it ſelf therein; the Sea comes up very high in it, and the greateſt Barks come up commodiouſly to the Key. The Seamen here are very skilful at catching Whales, and other large Fiſh. We were here very well entertain'd, ſo that our Tables were covered with all ſorts of Wild Fowl: but our Beds were not anſwerable, being ſtuck with Feathers whoſe Pinions ran into our ſides, and we wanted Quilts to lay on the top of them: I thought when we were to pay, that I ſhould have had a large Reckoning, but they only demanded of me half a <hi>Lewis Dor,</hi> when they would have coſt more than five Piſtoles at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Situation of St. <hi>John de Luz</hi> is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable.</p>
               <p>In the moſt ſpacious part of the Town you ſee here a very fine Church, built after the Modern Faſhion; and here is a Paſſage over the River <hi>Nivelle,</hi> on a Wooden Bridge of great length. Here are Toll-Gatherers, who make you pay for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151523:5"/> thing you carry with you, not excepting your Cloaths: This Tax is demanded at their Pleaſure; and it is exceſſive on Strangers. I was weary with ſpeaking <hi>French</hi> to 'em, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting I was no <hi>Spaniard;</hi> they feigning not to underſtand me, ſneering in my Face, and wrapping up their Heads in their Hooded-Gowns; they ſeem'd to me to be Thieves, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in <hi>Capuchins:</hi> In ſhort, they tax'd me eighteen Crowns, and would perſwade me they uſed me well, tho' I found the contrary. But I have already told you (dear Coſin), that when you travel this Country, you muſt ſtock your ſelf with Patience, and good ſtore of Money.</p>
               <p>I ſaw the Caſtle of <hi>Artois,</hi> which ſeems a ſtrong place; and a little farther <hi>Orognes,</hi> where the <hi>Biſcaye</hi> is ſpoken, without either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> I deſign'd to lye at <hi>Iron,</hi> which is but three Leagues diſtant from St. <hi>John de Luz</hi> and I had ſet out that after Noon, but the Diſpute which we had with the Watch on the Bridge, the Difficulty we had in paſſing the Mountains of <hi>Beotia,</hi> and the ill Weather, joyned to other little Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which hapned, were the Cauſe that it was Night before we arriv'd on the Borders of the River <hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi> which ſeparates <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spain.</hi> I obſerv'd along the way from <hi>Bayonne</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, little Carriages, on which they tranſport every thing, which have only two Iron Wheels, and the Noiſe they make is ſo great, that they are heard a mile off, when there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them together, which often happen; for you often meet with Sixty or Seventy at a time; they are drawn by Oxen. I have ſeen the ſame in the Villages of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the ſide of <hi>Axe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River of <hi>Bidaſſoa</hi> is uſually very ſmall, but the Snows melting, had increas'd it to ſuch a degree, that we had no ſmall trouble to paſs it, ſome in a Boat, and others ſwimming on their Mules: The Moon ſhined very bright, by means of which I was ſhew'd on the right Hand <hi>the Iſle of Conference,</hi> where the Marriage of our King was made with <hi>Maria Thereſe, Infanta of Spain.</hi> I ſaw a while after the Fort of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> which belongs to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtanding on the Mouth of this ſmall River: the Flux and Reflux of the Sea arrives here. Our Kings heretofore pretended it belong'd to them: there have been ſuch great Conteſts hereupon, eſpecially by the Inhabitants of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Andaye,</hi> that they have ſeveral times come to Blows. This oblig'd <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to agree, That it ſhould be common to both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> take Toll equally; theſe laſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151523:6"/> making thoſe pay who paſs into <hi>Spain,</hi> and the former doing the like in relation to thoſe who paſs over to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>War does not hinder Commerce on this Frontier: it's true they cannot ſubſiſt without it, ſeeing they muſt periſh through Want, did they not aſſiſt one another.</p>
               <p>This Country call'd <hi>Biſcaye,</hi> is full of high Mountains, where are ſeveral Iron Mines: The <hi>Biſcays</hi> climb up the Rocks as eaſily, and with as great ſwiftneſs as Stags: Their Language (if one may call ſuch <hi>Jargon</hi> Language) is very poor, ſeeing one Word ſignifies abundance of Things: There are none but thoſe born in the Country that can underſtand it; and I am told, that to the end it may be more particularly theirs, they make no uſe of it in Writing; they make their Children to read and write <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> according to which King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they are. It's certain, as ſoon as I paſt the little River of <hi>Bydaſſoa,</hi> I was not underſtood, unleſs I ſpake <hi>Caſtillan;</hi> and not above a quarter of an Hour before, I ſhould not have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood had I not ſpoke <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I found on the other ſide of this River a Banker of St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> to whom I was recommended: he tarried for me, with two of his Relations; they were cloath'd after the <hi>French</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ridiculouſly, their <hi>Juſtau Corps</hi> being ſhort and large, and their Sleeves hanging down very ſhort; thoſe of their Shirts were ſo large, that they hung down below their <hi>Juſtan Corps:</hi> they had Bands without Collars, and Periwigs, one of which had enough Hair for four, and ſo frizled, as made 'em look as if they were frighted; iller-dreſt People you cannot meet with. Thoſe who wear their own Hair, wear it very long and cloſe, parting it on the Crown, and paſs part of it behind their Ears: But what kind of Ears think you? thoſe of <hi>Midas</hi> were not larger; and I believe, that to lengthen them, they are ſtretch'd when they be young: without queſtion they find ſome kind of Beauty herein.</p>
               <p>My three <hi>Spaniards</hi> made me in bad <hi>French</hi> moſt tedious and dull Complements. We paſt through the Bourg of <hi>Tran,</hi> which is about a quarter of a League from the River, and came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Irun,</hi> which is diſtant about another quarter of a League: this little Town is the firſt of <hi>Spain</hi> which you meet with, leaving <hi>France:</hi> it's ill built, the Streets are unequal, and there's nothing one can ſpeak of: We entred into the Inn through the Stable, where are the Stairs on which you muſt aſcend to your Chamber; this is the Country's Faſhion. I found this Houſe very light, by a great many Candles, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151523:6"/> were as ſmall as Pack-thread; there were at leaſt forty in my Chamber, fixt on little bits of Wood; in the midſt of 'em ſtood a Pan of Coals burning, made of Olive Rhines, to take away the ſcent of the Candles.</p>
               <p>I had a great Supper, which my Gallants, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had caus'd to be made ready for me; but all was ſo full of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Saffron and Spice, that I could eat nothing: and I had made very bad Cheer, had not my Cook made me a little Ragon of what he could find.</p>
               <p>Determining to go but to St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> the next Morning, which is but ſeven or eight Leagues, I thought to Dine before I ſet out: I was ſitting at Table, when one of my Women brought me my Watch to wind it up, as it was my Cuſtom at Noon; it was a ſtriking Watch, of <hi>Tompion</hi>'s make, and coſt me fifty <hi>Lewiſes:</hi> My Banker, who was by me, ſhew'd ſome deſire to ſee it; I gave it him, with a cuſtomary Civility. This was enough: my Blade riſes, makes me a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, telling me, <q rend="margSglQuotes">He did not deſerve ſo conſiderable a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but ſuch a Lady as I could make no other: That he would engage his Faith and Reputation, that he would never part with my Watch as long as he liv'd; and that he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extreamly oblig'd to me. He kiſt it at the end of this pleaſant Complement, and thruſt it into his Pocket, which was deeper than a Sack.</q> You'l take me to be a gery great Sot, in ſaying nothing to all this, and I do not wonder at it; but I confeſs ingenuouſly, I was ſo ſurpriz'd at his Proceeding, that the Watch was out of ſight before I could reſolve on what I was to do. My Women, and the reſt of my Servants who were about me, ſtared on me, and I on them, bluſhing with Shame and Vexation to be thus caught: However, I recollected my ſelf, and conſidered, that this Man was to pay me a good round Sum of Money for the Charge of my Journey, and to return Money to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where I had taken it up; that having Bills of Credit on him, he might uſe ſeveral Tricks to me, and Put-offs, which might make me ſpend twice the Value of the Watch: In fine, I let him part with it, and endeavour'd to do my ſelf Honour from a thing which gave me great Mortification.</p>
               <p>I have learnt, ſince this little Adventure, that 'tis the Cuſtom in <hi>Spain,</hi> when any thing is preſented to one, if he likes it, and kiſſes your Hand, he may take it with him. This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant Faſhion, and being ſufficiently acquainted with it, 'twill be my Fault if I am Trapt again.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151523:7"/>
               <p>I left this Inn, where they peel'd me ſufficiently; for this is a grievous dear Country, and every one ſtrives to be Rich at his Neighbour's Coſt. A while after we had left the Town, we entred on the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, which are ſo high and ſteep, that looking down, you ſee, not without Horror, the Precipices which environ them: we went thus as far as <hi>Rentery: Don Antonio</hi> (which was my Banker's Name) went before me, and for my more commodious Paſſage, he oblig'd me to quit my Litter; for although we had traverſt ſeveral Mountains, yet there remain'd more difficult to paſs: he made me enter into a little Boat, which he had prepar'd to go down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Andaye,</hi> till we were near the Mouth of the Sea, where we ſaw the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Gallions; there were three very fine and large ones. Our little Boats were ſet forth with Gilt Streamers; they were manag'd by Girls, who were very luſty and handſome; there are three in each, two that Row, and one who holds the Rudder.</p>
               <p>Theſe Wenches are very well ſhaped, of Cheſnut Complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have very good Teeth, Hair Black, which they tie up with Ribbons, in Knots, and ſo let it hang behind them: They wear a kind of Veil on their Heads, made of Muſling, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Flowers of Gold and Silk, which hangs looſe, and covers their Breaſts: they wear Pendants in their Ears of Gold and Pearls, and Bracelets of Coral; they have a kind of <hi>Juſtau Corps,</hi> like our <hi>Gypſies,</hi> whoſe Sleeves are very ſtrait: I can aſſure you they charm'd me. I was told, theſe Wenches ſwim like Fiſhes, and ſuffer neither Women nor Men among them. This is a kind of Republick, where they repair from all Parts, and where their Parents ſend them very young.</p>
               <p>When they are willing to marry, they go to Maſs at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabia,</hi> which is the neareſt Town to 'em; and there the young Men come to chuſe 'em Wives to their Humour. He that will engage himſelf in <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Bonds, goes to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's Parents, declares to them his Intentions, regulates eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing with them: And this being done, notice of it is given to the Maid: If ſhe likes the Party, ſhe retires to their Houſe, where the Nuptuals are celebrated.</p>
               <p>I never ſaw a more gay Air than that on their Countenances; they have little Habitations along the Water-ſide, and there are old Maidens to whom the younger pay Reſpect, as to their Mothers. They related theſe Particulars to us in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and we hearken'd to 'em with great Delight, when the Devil, who never ſleeps, diſturb'd us with a vexatious Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151523:7"/>
               <p>My Cook, who is a <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> and exactly of the Humour of thoſe of that Country, was in one of our Boats behind us, at ſome diſtance, very near a young <hi>Biſcaneer,</hi> who appeared to him very handſome; he contented not himſelf with telling her as much, but would have rudely turn'd up her Veil. She being not uſed to this ſort of plain Dealing, without any Words broke his Head with her Oar: Having done this Exploit, Fear ſeizing on her, ſhe threw herſelf immediately into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' the Seaſon was very cold, and ſwam with great ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but having all her Cloaths on, and it being far to the Shoar, her ſtrength began to fail her. Several of theſe Wenches who ſaw this at Land, leapt immediately into their Boats to her Aſſiſtance, when thoſe who had remain'd in the Boat with the Cook, fearing the loſs of their Companion, fell on him like two Furies, reſolving by all means to drown him, and had like two or three times to have overturn'd their little Veſſel, which we beholding from ours, had much a-do to part and appeaſe them.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, the fooliſh <hi>Gaſcon</hi> was ſo cruelly handled, that he was all over blood; and my Banker told me, that theſe young <hi>Biſcaneers</hi> provoked, are worſe then Lions. In fine, we came to Land, but were ſcarcely on Shoar, but we ſaw this Wench which was ſaved out of the Water, making up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, with near fifty others, each with an Oar on their Shoulder, marching in Battle-ray, with Fife and Drum; when ſhe who was to be the Mouth of the Company, advanc'd, and calling me ſeveral times <hi>Andria,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>Madam,</hi> (for that's all I could retain of her Speech) gave me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That they would have my Cook's Skin, if Satisfaction were not made proportionably to the Damage done their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion's Cloaths. At the ending of which words, the She-Drummers fell loudly beating their Drums, and the reſt of their <hi>Amazons</hi> ſet up an Hollowing, Leaping and Dancing, and Fencing with their Oars in a moſt aſtoniſhing manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> to make me amends for the Preſent he had wrung from me, (I cannot but often mention it, lying on my Heart as it does) undertook to make Peace: He found that my Cook, who thought himſelf ſufficiently beaten, had Reaſon to give nothing; and therefore he diſtributed ſome Pieces of Money among this Marine Troop: On receipt of which they ſet forth lowder Hollow's than before, and wiſh'd me a good Journey, and ſpeedy Return, each of 'em dancing and ſinging at the ſound of their Pipes and Tabors.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:151523:8"/>
               <p>We entred into a very rough Way, and aſcending along ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow Paths, on the ſide of which there are Precipices; ſo that I was greatly afraid leſt the Mules which carry'd my Litter ſhould ſtumble: We afterwards paſt over a large Sandy Field. I tarry'd ſome time in the Convent of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which ſtands near the River of <hi>Andaye:</hi> We paſt over it on a very long Wooden Bridge; and though we were near St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> yet we could not then perceive it, becauſe a Mount of Sand hid the Town: It's ſituated on the Foot of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which ſerves on one ſide as a Rampart againſt the Sea, and the Veſſels come to the Foot of this Mountain, to ſhelter them from the Storms; for here ariſe extraordinary Tempeſts, that the Ships at Anchor periſh in the Port: it's deep, and defended by two Moles, which leave only as much room as is requiſite for one Veſſel paſſing at a time. They have rais'd here a great four Square Tower, where there is ever a good Garriſon to defend the Place, in caſe of Aſſault: it was a fine Day for the Seaſon: I found the Town very pleaſant, being ſurrounded with a double Wall: there are mounted ſeveral Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non on that part towards the Sea, with Baſtions and Half Moons: the Town is ſituated in a Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> call'd <hi>Guipuſcoa:</hi> the Out-parts are exceeding pleaſant, by reaſon that the Sea, as I now ſaid, ſerves for a Channel to it: the Streets of this Town are long and large, pav'd with great White Stones, which are always clean: the Houſes are well enough; and the Churches decent, in which the Altars are of Wood, on which are hung little Pictures, from top to bottom. Mines of Iron and Steel abound in this Country, finer and purer perhaps than in any other Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and this is the greateſt part of their Trade. Here the Wool which comes from <hi>Caſtille,</hi> is embark'd, which makes a conſiderable part of their Traffick. <hi>Bilbo</hi> and St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> are two of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ports which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has on the Ocean: The Caſtle ſtands very high, and may make an indifferent Defence: here are mounted ſeveral fine Pieces of Cannon, and there are a great many along the Ramparts; but the Garriſon is ſo weak, that the Women might conquer them with their Diſtaffs.</p>
               <p>Every thing is as dear in this Town as in <hi>Paris,</hi> yet they fare well here: Fiſh is excellent, and I was told Fruit was the ſame. I lay in the beſt Inn, and when I had been there ſome time, <hi>Don Fernand de Toledo,</hi> ſent his Gentlemen to enquire, whether his Viſit would not be troubleſome to me; My Banker, who knew him, and who was then in my Chamber, told me, he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151523:8"/> was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of great Quality, Nephew to the Duke <hi>D' Alva;</hi> that he came from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and was going to <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I receiv'd him with that Civility which was due to his Birth, and ſoon thereunto adjoyn'd particular Reſpects to his own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: He is a Gentleman of good Preſence, has Wit and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs is Complaiſant and Agreeable; he ſpeaks as good <hi>French</hi> as I do; but underſtanding <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and being deſirous to ſpeak it better, we therefore diſcours'd only in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>I was very well ſatisfied with his Carriage. He told me he came Poſt hither from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and if I pleas'd, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my Train, and be one of my Company. I thought he jeſted, and anſwered him accordingly; but he added, The ways were ſo full of Snow, that indeed they could not ride Poſt; that he could make more ſpeed on Horſes than in Litters, but the Honour of accompanying me, made abundant Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for that. In a word, I ſay he was a civil Perſon, and came no way ſhort of the Gallantry natural to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers: I therefore conſider'd, how advantageous it might prove to have a Man of this Quality, and Country, who could make himſelf be heard and obey'd by the Muletteers, who have Iron Souls, and no Conſciences.</p>
               <p>I told him, I was very glad I met with him, and the Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of the Road would be leſs'ned by his Company. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon ordered his Gentleman to find a Litter for him: It being late, he took his leave of me, and I betook my ſelf to eat a good Supper; for, my deer Couſin, I am none of thoſe Romantick Ladies that never eat.</p>
               <p>Scarcely did I begin to ſleep, when I heard ſome-body ſpeak <hi>French</hi> ſo near me, that I thought at firſt 'twas in my Chamber; but having hearkned with more attention, I found 'twas in a Chamber ſeparated from mine by only ſome thin Boards, and thoſe ill joynted: I drew my Curtain, and ſaw Light through the Crevices, and at the ſame time two young Women, the eldeſt of which appeared not to be above Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or Eighteen; neither of 'em were of thoſe Beauties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Defect, yet were they ſo pretty, ſpake ſo ſweetly, and had ſuch great ſweetneſs on their Countenances, that I was much taken with 'em.</p>
               <p>The youngeſt, who ſeem'd to, continue the Converſation, ſaid to the other, <hi>No, my dear Siſter, there is no Remedy to our Misfortunes; we must die, or get them out of the Clutches of this vilanous Dotard. I am reſolute for any thing,</hi> reply'd the other, in uttering a deep ſigh, <hi>ſhould it coſt me my Life: What
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151523:9"/> remains? Have we not ſacrific'd all for them?</hi> Then conſidering a while their Misfortunes, they mutually embrac'd, and began to weep in a moſt piteous manner: And having conſulted a while, and ſpake ſome other Words, the greateſt part of which were interrupted by their Sighs, they concluded on Writing, which they did; and here is moſt of what I heard them read to one another:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judge not of my Love and Grief by my Words, I have none can expreſs either the one or the other; but remember you Ruine me, unleſs you betake your ſelf to the greateſt Extremities againſt him that perſecutes us. He has now ſent me word,</hi> That if we delay our Departure, he will have us ſeiz'd. <hi>Conſider what he deſerves from this baſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of us; and remember you owe me all, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you owe me my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think the other Billet was in theſe Terms,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Could I ſecure thee thy Happineſs, in loſing mine, I love thee ſufficiently to offer thee ſuch a Sacrifice:: Yes, I would fly from thee, couldſt thou be Happy without me; but I know thy Heart too well to believe this. Yet thou remaineſt as Quiet in thy Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if I were with thee: Break thy Chains without more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; puniſh the Enemy of our Loves. My Heart ſhall be thy Recompenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having made up theſe Billets, they went out together; and I profeſs, I was not a little uneaſie for 'em, and no leſs curious to know theſe poor Ladies Misfortunes. This hindred me from ſleeping, and I was expecting their Return, when immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a great Uproar in the Houſe: I ſaw an old Man enter the Chamber, attended by a great many Servants: He held one of theſe young Women by the Hair of the Head, which he had wound about his Arm, and drew her after him, as a wretched Sacrifice. Her Siſter was not treated with leſs Cruelty, by thoſe who led her: <hi>Perfidious Wretches,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>not content with the irreparable Injury you do my Nephews, you would perſwade them to be my Executioners? Had I not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you with theſe ſeducing Letters what might have hapned? What dreadful Tragedies might I not have expected? But you ſhall pay once for all: as ſoon as ever the Day appears I will have you puniſht as you deſerve. Ah Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe whom he held, <hi>remember we are Women of Quality, and that our Alliance can be no Diſhonour to you; that your Nephews have given us their Faith, and we them ours; that in ſo tender an Age we have left all for their ſakes; that we are ſtrangers, and have no Friends here: What will become of us? We dare not return to our Relations: if you are for constraining us to this, or for putting us in Priſon, let us intreat you rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to diſpatch us out of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:151523:9"/>
               <p>The Tears which they ſhed in ſuch abundance, wrought in me the greateſt Compaſſion: And had the old Man been as tender as I, he had ſoon freed 'em from their Trouble.</p>
               <p>My Women, who had heard ſuch a great Diſturbance, and ſo near my Chamber, aroſe, in the fear of ſome Miſhap to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me: I made Signs to them to draw near ſoftly, and to behold through the Boards this ſorrowful Spectacle: We hearkned to what they ſaid, when two Men, with their Swords in their Hands, entred into my Chamber, the Door of which my Women had left open: They had Deſpair painted on their Faces, and Rage in their Eyes: I was ſo greatly frighted, that I cannot expreſs it to you. They looked on one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word; and having heard the old Man's Voice, they ran on that ſide.</p>
               <p>I did not doubt but 'twas the two Lovers; and 'twas them indeed, who entred like two Lions into this Chamber: They ſtruck theſe Servants with ſo great Terror, that never a one of 'em dared approach his Maſter, to defend him, when his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews advance towards him, and ſet their Swords to his Throat: <hi>Barbarian,</hi> ſaid they to him, <hi>can you thus uſe Women of Quality, that are to be our Wives? Becauſe you are our Guardian muſt you therefore be our Tyrant? And is not the ſeparating of us from what we love, the taking of our Lives from us? It's now in our Power to take a juſt Vengeance of you; but we cannot do it to a Man of your Age, who cannot defend himſelf: give us then your Word, and ſwear by all that's Good and Holy, That in Acknowledgment for the Life we give you, you will contribute to our Happineſs, and ſuffer us to perform what we have promis'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor old Wretch was ſo afrighted, that he could hardly make any Anſwer: However, he ſwore more than they would have him; he fell on his Knees, and kiſt an hundred times his Thumb laid a-croſs one of his Fingers, after the manner of <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet he told them, <hi>whatever he had done, was onely in regard to their Intereſts; however, he would not in any ſort, for the future, oppoſe their Inclinations, in reference to this Marriage.</hi> Two of the Domeſticks took him under the Arm, and rather carried him away than led him. Then the Gentlemen ſeeing themſelves free, threw themſelves in their Miſtreſſes Arms; they ſaid to one another, whatever Grief, Love and Joy do uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in ſuch Occaſions. But in Troth, one muſt have a Heart as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and content as theirs, to repeat all theſe things: they are only proper to Perſons more tender than you are, my dear Coſin. But I hope you will excuſe this Relation; I was ſo tired, in having not yet ſlept, that I could ſcarce hear any more, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151523:10"/> confuſedly: and to hear no more, I got farther into bed, and threw the Quilt over my Head.</p>
               <p>The next Morning <hi>Don Fernand de Toledo,</hi> ſent me ſome choice Wines, with great quantity of Oranges and Sweetmeats. As ſoon as he thought it a proper time to Viſit me, he came: Having thankt him for his Preſent, I ask'd him, Whether he had heard nothing of what had paſt in the Night? He told me, <hi>No,</hi> for he had lain in another part of the Houſe. I was about relating to him what I knew, when our Hoſteſs entred into the Chamber: ſhe came from the two Gentlemen who had given me that Diſturbance, with the Swords in their Hands, intreating me to receive their Excuſes. She likewiſe told me, That two young Ladies deſired they might wait on me, and kiſs my Hand. I anſwer'd theſe Civilities as I ought; and they ſoon entred.</p>
               <p>What charming Effects does the Return of Joy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? I found theſe Gentlemen very well ſhaped, and theſe Ladies very lovely; neither one nor the other had any more on their Countenances the Characters of Deſpair; an Air of Gaiety diſplay'd itſelf in all their Words and Geſtures. The Eldeſt of the two Brethren made the moſt handſome Excuſe as is poſſible for his Miſtake in entring my Chamber: he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <q rend="margQuotes">He had well obſerv'd the Fear he had caus'd me; but told me, that in that Moment he was ſo tranſported, that he was capable of no other Thought but the Reſcuing his Miſtreſs.</q> 
                  <hi>You would have been to blame,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>ſhould you have thought of any thing elſe: However, if it be true, you are willing to make me Satisfaction for the Alarum you have giv'n me, you muſt not refuſe the gratifying my Curioſity: With theſe fair Ladies leave, inform we what has reduced all of you to theſe Extremities you were in.</hi> He lookt on them, as if it were to ask their Approbation, which they willingly granted; and he thus began: <hi>We are two Brothers, Madam, Natives of</hi> Burgos, <hi>and of one of the beſt Families of this City. We were very young, when we fell into the Hands of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, who took care of our Education and Eſtates, which are ſo conſiderable, that we need not envy others on that account;</hi> Don Diego <hi>(is our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle's Name) he had made long ſince a firm Friendſhip with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man living near</hi> Blaye, <hi>whoſe Merit is far above his Fortune; he is call'd</hi> Monſieur de Meſignac: <hi>our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle reſolving to ſend us for ſome time into</hi> France, <hi>he wrote hereupon to his Friend, who offered him his Houſe, which he joyfully accepted. He made us ſet out; and it is a Year ſince we were receiv'd there with great Civility;</hi> Madam de Meſſignac <hi>uſed us as her own Children; ſhe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151523:10"/> has ſeveral: but of her four Daughters, thoſe you ſee are the moſt amiable. It would have been very difficult to have ſeen them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, to dwell with them, and yet not to have loved them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Brother at first conceal'd from me his growing Paſſion, and I hid mine from him; we were both of us very melancholly; the trouble of loving, without being lov'd again, and the fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing thoſe who caus'd our Paſſion, all this cruelly tormented us; but a new Vexation did greatly increaſe our Diſquiet, which was a reſtleſs Jealouſie we had one of another: My Brother plainly ſaw I was in Love, and thought 'twas with his Mistreſs; I lookt on him likewiſe as my Rival; and we bore ſuch Hatred to one another, as might have tranſported us to the greateſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: but that I reſolutely determin'd one day to diſcover my Sentiments to</hi> Mademoiſelle de Meſſignac; <hi>but wanting Courage to ſpeak to her my ſelf, I wrote ſome Verſes in a little Book touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Paſſion for her, and dextrouſly ſlid it into her Pocket, without her perceiving me. My Brother, who had always an Eye on me, obſerv'd it, and playing with her, he took out the Verſes, and found 'em to contain a reſpectful and paſſionate Declaration of Love to her: he kept them till Night, when being withdrawn into my Chamber, with the greatest Inquietude, he came to me, and tenderly embracing me, he told me, He was heartily glad at the notice he had of my being in love with</hi> Mademoiſelle de Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignac.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I remain'd as one Thunderſtruck; I ſaw my Papers in his Hands; I imagin'd ſhe had made them a Sacrifice to him, and that he came to inſult on my Misfortune. He ſaw in my Eyes and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance part of what I thought:</hi> Undeceive your ſelf, <hi>continued he,</hi> ſhe gave 'em not to me; I have taken 'em without her ſeeing them: I'll be ſerviceable to you for the obtaining her; be you the ſame to me in relation to her elder Siſter. <hi>I then embraced him, and promis'd him all he deſired. Thus we mutually rendred good Offices to one another; and our Miſtreſſes, who were not then acquainted with the power of Love, began to accuſtom themſelves to hear talk of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It would be to abuſe your Patience, to tell you, Madam, how we came at length by our Cares and Aſſiduities to win their Hearts. What happy Moments! what ſweet Hours! to ſee without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what one loves, and to be beloved! to be together in the Fields, where an Innocent and Country Life let's one taſte, without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, the Pleaſures of a growing Paſſion; this is a Felicity which cannot be exprest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winter being come,</hi> Madam de Meſſignac <hi>was at</hi> Bourdeaux, <hi>where ſhe had a Houſe; we accompanied her thither; but this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151523:11"/> Houſe was not great enough to ledge us, with all our Family; we took one near hers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though this Separation was only the Nights, yet we had lively Reſentments of it; we were not now every Moment with 'em; our Viſits were accompanied with a certain Air of Ceremonies, which diſturb'd us. But our Alarums were much increas'd, when we ſaw two rich handſome Sparks addreſs themſelves to</hi> Mademoiſelles de Meſſignac, <hi>and earneſtly Court them, and that with the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Parents. Good God, how we look'd! Their Proceedings went on at a great rate, and our dear Miſtreſſes, who ſhared in our Sorrow, mingled every day their Tears with ours. In fine, having throughly tormented our ſelves, by deviſing a thouſand fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ways, I reſolv'd to Addreſs my ſelf to</hi> Monſieur de Meſſignac: <hi>I ſpake to him, and told him what my Paſſion inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, to perſwade him to defer theſe Marriages. He anſwered,</hi> He accepted, with the greateſt Acknowledgments, the Offers my Brother and I made him; but being not of Age, what we might do at preſent might be afterwards Cancell'd: That his Honour was dear to him, though his Eſtate was ſmall; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould always eſteem himſelf Happy, in living without Reproach: That my Uncle, who had entruſted us to him, might juſtly accuſe him of Seducing us; and that in ſhort, we muſt no more think of theſe Matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I withdrew in the greateſt Affliction, which I ſhared with my Brother; and this was a dreadful trouble among us.</hi> Monſieur de Meſſignac, <hi>to compleat our misfortunes, ſent an Account to my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, of what had paſt, and earneſtly intreated him to lay his Commands on us to be gone. He did ſo; and ſeeing no remedy to our Misfortunes, we went, my Brother and I, to</hi> Mademoiſelles de Meſſignac, <hi>we threw ourſelves at their Feet; We told them what might perſwade Hearts already pre-poſſeſt: We gave them our Faith and Promiſes, Sign'd with our Blood: In ſhort, Love made an end of vanquiſhing them; they conſerted to go with us. In fine, we took ſuch Meaſures, that our Paſſage was happy enough till our Arrival here; and it is not two days ſince entring this Houſe, the firſt Perſon offering himſelf to us was</hi> Don Diego; <hi>He was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of our Return; and to ſatisfie himſelf, he came in queſt of us. How did we look at this ſight! He caus'd us to be apprehended as Criminals; and forgetting that</hi> Mademoiſelles de Meſſignac, <hi>were the Daughters of his beſt Friend, and Perſons of Quality, he loaded them with Injuries, and o're-whelm'd them with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, after he had learnt from one of my Servants, that we had reſolv'd to paſs</hi> Incognito <hi>as far as</hi> Madrid, <hi>to ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we had there, to tarry in this place for a full liberty of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151523:11"/> declaring our Marriage. He lock't us up in a Chamber next to his; and we were there, when theſe Ladies came by Moon-light, coughing under our Windows. We heard them, and ran to them —They ſhew'd us their Letters; and we were deviſing on our Deliverance, when my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, having notice of what paſt, ſilently came upon us with all his Servants, and before our Faces miſuſed theſe amiable Creatures. In the Exceſs of our Deſpair our Strength, without doubt, increas'd. We broke open the Doors, which were faſt ſhut on us, and we ran to Succour them, when imprudently, Madam, we came into your Chamber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman here ſtopt, and I found he had related his little Hiſtory with great Ingenuity. I thank't him for it, and offer'd theſe Ladies my Endeavours, and thoſe of my Friends, to appeaſe their Family: Which Offers they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and teſtifi'd their Acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>Some Ladies of the Town, who came to ſee me, wou'd ſtop me; they propoſed to me to go to the Religioſes, whoſe Convent is ſo pleaſantly ſituated, that the Proſpect has no Bounds: You may ſee thence, at the ſame time, the Sea, Ships, Towns, Woods and Fields. They ſpake much in praiſe of the Voices, Beauty, and good Humour of theſe Religioſes. Add to this, that the ill Weather was ſo increaſt, and the Snow fal'n in ſo great abundance, that no body adviſed me to proceed in my Journey. I was in ſuſpence a while, but the Impatience I had to be at <hi>Madrid,</hi> prevail'd over all theſe Conſiderations, and I parted the next Morning. I have receiv'd of my Banker the Money I want.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not forget to tell you, that the Inhabitants of this Town have a particular Priviledge, and of which they are not a little proud; which is, That when they Treat of any Affairs with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that it is directly with him, he is oblig'd to ſpeak with them bare-headed. I could not get the Reaſon from 'em for this.</p>
               <p>I am told I muſt furniſh my ſelf with good ſtore of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, to prevent ſtarving in ſome places through which we muſt paſs; and Gammons of Bacon, dried Tongues, being much eſteem'd in this Country, I have therefore taken up a good quantity; and as to the reſt, we have ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. Now this being the Poſt-day, I would not omit this occaſion of informing you of what has hapned to me; and teſtifying, that I am,</p>

               <head>LETTER. II.</head>
               <p>I Re-aſſume, Dear Couſin, without any Compliments, the Sequel of my Travels: In leaving St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> we entred into a very rough Way, which brings you to ſuch terrible ſteep Mountains, that you cannot aſcend them without climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they are call'd <hi>Sierra de</hi> St. <hi>Adrian.</hi> They ſhew only Precipices and Rocks, on which a puling Lover may meet with certain Death, if he has a mind to it. Pine Trees of an extraordinary heighth crown the top of theſe Mountains. As far as the Sight will reach you ſee nothing but Deſarts, cut with Streams clearer than Cryſtal. Near the higheſt part of Mount St. <hi>Adrian,</hi> you meet with an elevated Rock, which ſeems to have been placed in the midſt of the way to block up the Paſſage, and thus ſeparate <hi>Biſcaye</hi> from the <hi>Old Caſtille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A tedious and painful Labour has pierced this maſs of Stone in manner of a Vault; you may walk forty or fifty Paces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, without ſight of Day, but what comes by the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at each Entry, which are ſhut by great Doors: You find under this Vault an Inn, which is left in the Winter, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Snows: You ſee here likewiſe a little Chappel of St. <hi>Adrian,</hi> and ſeveral Caverns, where Thieves commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; ſo that it is dangerous paſſing here without being in a condition of Defence. When he had traverſt the Rock, we ſtill a little aſcended, to rrrive to the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is held to be the higheſt of the <hi>Pyraneds;</hi> it is wholly covered with great Aſh Trees. There was never a finer place of Solitude; the Springs run here as in the Vallies: the ſight is only bounded by the Weakneſs of the Eyes; Shades and Silence here reign, and the Eccho's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers on every ſide. We began afterwards to deſcend down faſter than we climed up: We ſaw in ſome parts little barren Plains, many ſandy places, and ever and anon Mountains co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with great Rocks. It is not without Reaſon, that in paſſing ſo near, you fear, leſt ſome one of 'em ſhould get looſe, which would certainly over-whelm one; for you ſee ſome which are fall'n from the top, and hang in their paſſage on other Clefts; and theſe finding nothing in the way, would give a ſorry Diverſion to a Traveller. I made all theſe Reflections at my eaſe; for I was alone in my Litter, with my Child, who did not at all diſturb my Thoughts. A River call'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rrola,</hi> big enough, but which was increaſed by the Torrents, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Snow, ſlides along the Way, and breaks forth into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151523:12"/> Streams in ſome places, which fall with a great impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and noiſe, and make a very pleaſant ſound and ſight.</p>
               <p>We meet not here with thoſe fine Caſtles to be ſeen on the Banks of the <hi>Loire,</hi> which make Travellers call it the Country of <hi>Fairies.</hi> Here are on theſe Mountains only ſome Shepherds Cottages, and ſome few Hovels, and at that diſtance, that you muſt go a great way before you can find them; yet all theſe Natural Objects, though very melancholly ones, yet have ſomething that is very taking in them. The Snows were ſo high, that we had always twenty Men, who made way for us with Shovels. You will perhaps imagine this coſt me very much; but here are ſo well eſtabliſht Orders, and thoſe ſo well obſerv'd, that the Inhabitants of a Village are oblig'd to meet Travellers, and be their Guides to the next; and no one being bound to give them any thing, the leaſt Liberality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſatisfies them. To this firſt Care there is added another, which is that of Ringing the Bells without-ceaſing, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Travellers, where they may retreat in ſtormy Weather. They told me, there had not fall'n this forty Years ſo much Snow as we met with, there having been no Froſt for a great while in this Province.</p>
               <p>Our Troop was ſo great, that we might count our ſelves no ways inferiour to thoſe Famous Caravans which go to <hi>Mecha;</hi> for without reckoning my Train, and that of <hi>Don Fernand de Toledo,</hi> there joyn'd with us near St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> three Knights, with their Attendants, who return'd from their Commander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of St. <hi>James;</hi> there were two of this Order, and one of that of <hi>Alcantara:</hi> The firſt wear Red Croſſes, in form of an embroidered Sword, on their Shoulders; and he of <hi>Alcantara</hi> had a Green one. One of the two firſt is of <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> the other of <hi>Galicia,</hi> and the third of <hi>Catalonia;</hi> they are of good Families; he of <hi>Andalouſia</hi> calls him ſelf, <hi>Donesteve de Carvaial;</hi> he of <hi>Galicia, Don Sancho Sanniento,</hi> and the other of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia, Don Frederic de Cardonne;</hi> they are Perſons of good Meine, and well acquainted with the World. I receiv'd all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Civilities from them, having much of the <hi>French</hi> Humour in them. They have travelled over the greateſt Part of <hi>Europe;</hi> and this has rendred them ſo Polite. We went to lye at <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reta;</hi> this is a Borough a little diſtant from Mount <hi>Adrian,</hi> ſituated in the little Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> I now mention'd na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Alava,</hi> which makes a Part of <hi>Biſcaye;</hi> we had there but bad Entertainment. They reckon it eleven Leagues from thence to St. <hi>Sebaſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had better Way from <hi>Galareta</hi> to <hi>Victoria,</hi> than we had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151523:13"/> before: The Country here yields much Corn and Grapes; and the Villages lie very thick together: We found here Cuſtom-Houſe-Men, who made us pay both for the Cloaths and Money we carried with us: they were not very exacting with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Company was too large to be impoſed on. <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de Toledo</hi> had inform'd me over Night, that we were to travel near the Caſtle of <hi>Quebare,</hi> which was ſaid to be haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Spirit, telling me a thouſand extravagant Stories, which were readily ſwallow'd by the Inhabitants of the Country, and which were ſo effectually believ'd by them, that no body would live there. I had a great deſire to ſee this place; for although I am naturally as fearful as another, yet am not afraid of Ghoſts; and if I were, our Company was ſo numerous, as would animate the greateſt Coward: we ſtruck off a little to the left, and came to the Borough of <hi>Quebara;</hi> the Maſter of the Inn where we entred, had the Keys of the Caſtle; he told us, in going along with us, <hi>That the</hi> Duende, which is to ſay the Spirit, <hi>could not endure Company; yet if we were a thouſand together, he would, if he were minded, beat us all, in ſuch a manner, as to leave us for dead.</hi> I began to tremble; <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de Toledo,</hi> and <hi>Don Fredric de Cordonne,</hi> who gave me their Hands, perceiving my Fear, burſt out into Laughter: I grew aſham'd, and pretended to gain Courage; and ſo we entred the Caſtle, which might have paſt for a fine one, had it been kept in order: It had no Furniture, except an old Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry Hanging in a great Hall, which repreſented the Amours of <hi>Don Pedro the Cruel,</hi> and <hi>Donna Maria de Padilla:</hi> ſhe is repreſented fitting like a Queen in the midſt of other Ladies, and the King placing on her Head a Crown of Flowers: In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part ſhe ſate under the ſhade of a Wood, the King ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a Hawk on his Fiſt: And again, in another, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a Warrier's Dreſs, and the King in Armour preſents her with a Sword; which makes me believe that ſhe had been in ſome Warlike Expedition with him. She was very ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; and <hi>Don Fernand</hi> told me, <q rend="margSglQuotes">He had ſeen her Effigies elſewhere, by which ſhe appeared to be the moſt beautiful and moſt cruel Woman of her time; and that the Figures in this Tapiſtry reſembled neither her nor the King: his Name, Cipher and Arms were every-where on it.</q> We went up into a Tower, on the top of which was a Dungeon, and 'twas there where the Spirit inhabited; but without doubt he was abroad, for we neither ſaw nor heard him, or any of his Companions; and having ſeen ſufficiently this great Building, we left it to purſue our Journey. In approaching <hi>Victoria,</hi> we paſt over a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151523:13"/> moſt delightful Plain, at the end of which ſtands a Town ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> I lately mention'd, call'd <hi>Alava;</hi> this is the Capital Town of it, as well as the firſt of <hi>Caſtille:</hi> It is incloſed with two Walls, one of which is old, and the other new; beſides this, it has no other Fortifications. After I had refreſh'd my ſelf a while here, 'twas propoſed to me to go to a Play; but in tarrying till it began, I had no ſmall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, in ſeeing come into the moſt ſpacious place of the Town, four Companies of young Men, preceded by Drums and Trumpets: they marched ſeveral times round, and in fine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began the Fight with Snow-balls, which they threw at one another with ſuch Fierceneſs, that they were all very well pelted in the end: they were above two hundred who fought this Battle. To tell you of thoſe who fell, or recovered their Feet again, and the Shouts and Acclamations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will be needleſs; and I was obliged to leave them thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to go to the place where the Play was to be repreſented.</p>
               <p>When I entred into the Room, the People ſet forth an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Mira, mira!</hi> which is to ſay, look, Look,! The Decorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Theatre was not over Magnificent; it was rais'd on Barrels, and ill-rang'd Plancks; the Windows of the Room were open, for they uſed no Candles or Flambeaux, whence you may eaſily imagine this much takes away from the Beauty of the Sight. They acted the Life of St. <hi>Anthony;</hi> and when the Players ſaid any thing which pleas'd the Company, all the People cried out, <hi>Victoria, Victoria;</hi> I was informed this was the Cuſtom of the Country. I obſerv'd the Devil was no other ways clad than the reſt, having only a pair of Stockins of a Flame-colour, and a pair of Horns to diſtinguiſh him. This Comedy conſiſted only of three Acts, and they are all no more: at the end of each ſerious Act, another began of Farce and Pleaſantry, wherein appear'd him they called <hi>El Gracioſo,</hi> which is to ſay, the Buffoon, who, among much inſipid Stuff, ſays ſometimes ſomething that is leſs nauſeous: The Interludes were mixt with Dances, to the ſound of the Harps and Guitars: The Actors had Caſtagnets, and a little Hat on their Heads, without which they never Dance, and then 'tis a Saraband; they ſeem not to walk, they ſlip along ſo lightly. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is wholly different from ours: they move too much their Arms, and often paſs their Hands on their Hats and Face, and that with no ill Grace; they play admirably well on the Caſtagnets.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, (Dear Coſin) I would not have you think theſe Actors, for being in a little City, do much differ from thoſe of <hi>Madrid.</hi> I was told, that thoſe of the King are a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151523:14"/> little better; but, in a word, both act what they call <hi>Las Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias Famoſas,</hi> which is to ſay, The fineſt and moſt famous Comedies; which in truth are very ridiculous: For Example, when St. <hi>Anthony</hi> ſaid his <hi>Confiteor,</hi> which he did often enough, all the Spectators fell down on their Knees, and gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch rude <hi>Mea Culpa's,</hi> as was enough to beat the breath out of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>Here would be a proper place to ſpeak of their Habits; but you had better excuſe me till I come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> leſt I tire you with Repetitions: Yet I muſt tell you, that all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies I ſay, in this Company, had a prodigious quantity of Red, which begins juſt under the Eye, and paſſes from the Chin to the Ears, and Shoulders, to their very Hands; ſo that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any Radiſhes of a finer Colour.</p>
               <p>The Lady Governeſs of the Town drew near to me; ſhe juſt toucht my Cloaths, and haſtily drew back her Hand, as if ſhe had burnt her Fingers. I bid her in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: She at length familiariz'd her ſelf, and told me, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Twas not through fear of any thing elſe but of diſpleaſing me: that 'twas no new thing to her to ſee <hi>French</hi> Ladies: and that if ſhe might, ſhe would gladly dreſs her ſelf after their Faſhion.</q> She ordered Chocolate to be brought her, with which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me; which is far better here than in <hi>France.</hi> The Play being ended, I took my Leave of her, having thanked her for her Civilities.</p>
               <p>The next Morning, as I entred the Church to hear Maſs, I eſpied an Hermit, who had the Air of a Perſon of Quality, and yet begg'd an Alms of me, with ſuch great Humility, that I was greatly ſurpriz'd at it: <hi>Don Fernand</hi> having notice of it, drew near, and ſaid to me, <hi>The Perſon whom you behold, Madam, is of an illuſtrious Family, and of great Merit, but his Fortune very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You raiſe in me,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>a great Curioſity to know more; and therefore I muſt beg your Favour to ſatisfie it. You may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing of me,</hi> replied he, <hi>Madam; but I am not ſo throughly inform'd of his Adventures, to undertake the relating them to you; and I believe 'twere better I engage him into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of them himſelf.</hi> He left me, and went immediately to Embrace him, with the greateſt Civilities and Tenderneſs: <hi>Don Frederic de Cardonne,</hi> and <hi>Don Eſteve de Carvajal,</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accoſted him, as their old Acquaintance; and when <hi>Don Fernand</hi> had joyn'd them, they all earneſtly intreated him to come with them when Maſs was over. He as earneſtly excuſed himſelf; but being told, I was a Stranger, and much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151523:14"/> that I might learn from himſelf, what had oblig'd him to turn Hermit; he at length conſented, on condition I would permit him to bring one of his Friends, who was perfectly knowing in what related to him: <hi>Do us Juſtice,</hi> continued he, <hi>and judge whether 'tis fit for me to relate ſuch Particularities in this Habit I wear.</hi> They found he had Reaſon, and pray'd him to bring his Friend, which he did a while after I was at my Lodgings: He preſented a very fine Cavalier to me; and taking leave of us very civilly, he told him, <q rend="margSglQuotes">He ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to him, if he would ſatisfie, the Curioſity which <hi>Don Fernand de Toledo</hi> had giv'n me, of knowing the Spring of his Misfortunes.</q> This Gentleman took place by me, and began in theſe Terms:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I think my ſelf very Happy, Madam, that my Friend has choſhen me to ſatisfie the Deſire you have of knowing his Adventures; but I fear I ſhall not acquit my ſelf ſo well as I would: The Perſon whoſe Hiſtory you wou'd learn, has been one of the fineſt Gentlemen in the World; it would be hard to make a Judgment of him now; he is buried, as it were in his Hermit's Habit. He was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding graceful Perſon, well ſhaped, of an excellent Meine, and Noble Air: And in fine, had all the Accompliſhments, both Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Acquired, of a Perſon of Quality, being liberal, witty and brave. He was born at</hi> Cagliari, <hi>Capital of the Iſle of</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogne, <hi>one of the moſt illuſtrious and richest Families of all that Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was brought up with one of his Coſin-Germans; and the ſimpathy which was ſound in their Humours, and Inclinations, was ſo great, that they were more ſtrictly united by Friendſhip than Blood: they hid no Secret from each other. And when the Marquiſs</hi> Barbaran <hi>was married (which was his Coſin's Name,) their Friendſhip continued in the ſame force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He married one of the fineſt Women in the World, and the moſt Accompliſht; ſhe was then not above Fourteen: She was Heireſs to a very Noble Eſtate and Family. The Marqueſs every day diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered new Charms in the Wit and Perſon of his Wife, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe increaſed every day his Paſſion. He ſpeaks without ceaſing, of his Happineſs, to</hi> Don Lewis de Barbaron; <hi>which is the Name, Madam, of my Friend; and when any Affairs oblig'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs to leave her, he conjured him to stay with the Marchioneſs, thereby to leſſen the Trouble of his Abſence. But alas! how hard is it when one is at an Age uncapable of ſerious Reflections, to ſee continually ſo fair a Woman, ſo young and aimable; and to ſee her with Indifference!</hi> Don Lewis <hi>was already deſperately in Love with the Marchioneſs, and thought then 'twas only for her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151523:15"/> Husband's ſake: Whilſt he was in this Miſtake, ſhe fell danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſick; at which he grew ſo dreadful melancholly, that he then knew, but too late, this was caus'd by a Paſſion which would prove the greateſt Misfortunes of his whole Life. Finding himſelf then in this condition, and having not ſtrength to reſist it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to uſe the utmost Extremity, and to fly and avoid a place where he was in danger of dying with Love, or breaking through the Bonds of Friendſhip. The most cruel Death wou'd have ſeem gentler than the Execution of this Deſign: When the Marchioneſs beginning to grow better, he went to her to bid her Adieu, and ſee her no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He found her buſied in chooſing among ſeveral Stones of great price, thoſe which were the fineſt, which ſhe intended to have ſet in a Ring,</hi> Don Lewis <hi>was ſcarce entred the Chamber, but ſhe deſired him, with that Air of Familiarity uſual among Relations to go and fetch her other Stones which ſhe moreover had in her Cabinet. He ran thither, and by an unexpected good hap, found among what he lookt for, the Picture enamill'd of the Marchioneſs, in little, ſet with Diamonds, and incircled with a Lock of her Hair; it was ſo like, that he had not the power to withſtand the deſire he had of stealing it:</hi> I am going to leave her, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I ſhall ſee her no more; I ſacrifice all my quiet to her Husband: Alas! is not this enough? And may I not without a Crime, ſearch in my Pain a Conſolation ſo innocent as this. <hi>He kiſt ſeveral times this Picture; he put it under his Arm, he carefully hid it, and returning towards her with theſe Stones, he trembling told her the Reſolution he had taken of Travelling. She appear'd much amazed at it, and chang'd her colour. He lookt on her at this moment; he had the pleaſure of perceiving it; and their Eyes being of Intelligence, ſpake more than their Words:</hi> Alas! What can oblige you, <hi>Don Lewis, ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> to leave us? Your Coſin loves you ſo tenderly; I eſteem you; we are never pleas'd without you; he cannot live from you: Have you not already travelled? You have without doubt ſome other Reaſon for your Departure, but at leaſt do not hide it from me. Don Lewis, <hi>pierc'd through with ſorrrow, could not forbear uttering a deep Sigh, and taking one of the delicate Hands of the Charming Perſon, on which he fixt his Mouth,</hi> Ah, Madam, what do you ask me? <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> What can I ſay to you? And indeed, What can I ſay to you, in the Condition I am in? <hi>The Violence he uſed, to conceal his Sentiments, caus'd him ſuch a great Weakneſs, that he fell half dead at her Feet. She remained troubled and confuſed at this ſight: She oblig'd him to ſit down by her; ſhe dared not lift up her Eyes to look on him; but ſhe let him ſee Tears, which ſhe could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſhedding, nor reſolve to conceal from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:151523:15"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scarcely were they come to themſelves, when the Marqueſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Chamber. He came to embrace</hi> Don Lewis <hi>with all the Testimonies of a perfect Friendſhip, and he was in the greateſt trouble, when he understood he parted for</hi> Naples. <hi>He omitted no Arguments to perſwade him from it, prest his ſtay with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Earneſtneſs, but all in vain. He there immediately took his leave of the Marchioneſs, and ſaw her no more. The Marqueſs went out with him, he left him not till the moment of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. This was an Augmentation of</hi> Don Lewis<hi>'s Sorrow; he would have willingly remained alone to have an intire Liberty of afflicting himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Marchioneſs was ſenſibly afflicted at this Separation: She had perceived he loved her, before he had known thus much himſelf; and ſhe had found in him ſuch ſingular Merit, that for her part too ſhe had loved him without knowing it; but ſhe found this to her Coſt after his Departure: Recovering but lately from a dangerous Sickneſs, of which ſhe was not perfectly cured, this unhappy Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made her fall into a languiſhing Indiſpoſition, as ſoon rendred her quite another body; her Duty, her Reaſon, her Vertue equally perſecuted her: She was greatly ſenſible of her Husband's Reſpects to her, and ſhe could not ſuffer but with great Sorrow, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould take up her thoughts, and have ſo great a place in her Affections. She dared not any more mention the Name of</hi> Don Lewis; <hi>ſhe never made any Inquiries after him; ſhe made it an indiſpenſable Duty to forget him: This Violence which ſhe uſed on her ſelf, was like a continual Martyrdom; ſhe made one of her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in whom ſhe most confided, the Repoſitory of this Secret:</hi> Am I not very unhappy? <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I muſt wiſh never again to ſee a Man, towards whom it is impoſſible for me to be in a ſtate of Indifference; his Perſon is always before mine Eyes; nay, I think ſometimes I ſee him in the Perſon of my Husband; the Reſemblance which is between them, ſerves only to nouriſh my Affection towards him. Alas! <hi>Mariana,</hi> I muſt die, to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this Crime, although it be an involuntary one: I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this means to get rid of a Paſſion of which I cannot hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be Miſtreſs: Alas, what have I not done to ſtifle it, this Paſſion which yet is dear to me. <hi>She accompany'd theſe Words with a thouſand Sighs: She melted into Tears, and though this Woman had a great deal of Wit and Affection to her Miſtreſs, yet ſhe could ſay nothing to her could yield her any Comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Marqueſs in the mean time, every day reproacht his Wife with her Indifferency to</hi> Don Lewis: I cannot ſuffer, <hi>ſaid be to her,</hi> that you ſhould think ſo little on the Man I love above all the World, and who had ſo much Complaiſance and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151523:16"/> for you: I muſt needs ſay, this is a kind of Hardneſs, which would make one judge untowardly of the Tenderneſs of your Heart: At leaſt, you muſt grant, Madam, that he was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone, but you forgot him. What good would my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring him do him? <hi>ſaid the Marchioneſs with a languiſhing Air,</hi> Do not you ſee he avoids us? Would he not have been ſtill with us, if he had any real Kindneſs for us? Believe me, my Lord, he deſerves a little that we ſhould forſake him in our turn. <hi>Whatever ſhe could ſay, repel'd not the Marqueſs; he ſtill impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd her to write to</hi> Don Dewis <hi>to Return. One Day among the reſt, ſhe was gotten into his Cloſet to ſpeak to him about ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; ſhe found him buſied in reading a Letter of</hi> Don Lewis, <hi>which he lately receiv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She would have retir'd; but he took this opportunity to oblige her to do what he would have her; he told her very ſeriouſly,</hi> That he could no longer bear the Abſence of his Coſin; that he was reſolv'd to go find him; that 'twas already two Years ſince he had been gone, without intimating any deſire of returning to his Friends and Country; that he was perſwaded he would yield a greater Deference to her Requeſts than his; that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to write to him: And that in fine, ſhe might chuſe either to give him this Satisfaction, or be content to ſee him, part for <hi>Naples,</hi> where <hi>Don Lewis</hi> was to make ſome ſtay. <hi>She remain'd ſurpriz'd, and perplext at this Propoſal; but knowing he expected with great Impatience her Determination,</hi> What would you have me ſay to him, my Lord? <hi>ſaid ſhe to him with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Countenance,</hi> Dictate this Letter to me, I will write it; I can do no more; and I believe this is more than I ought <hi>The Marqueſs, tranſported with Joy, moſt affectionately embrac'd her; he thank'd her for her Compliance, and made her write theſe Words:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF you have any Kindneſs for us, defer not your Return; I have very urgent Reaſons to deſire it. I am not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd that you ſhew ſuch Indifference towards us, which is an unqueſtionable Indication that you take no Delight in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Return, <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> I earneſtly wiſh it; I intreat you: And if it were fit for me to uſe more urgent Terms, I would ſay, perhaps, I Command you to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Marqueſs made a ſingle Pacquet of this fatal Letter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:151523:16"/> of this Lover at the ſight of ſo dear and unexpected an Order! Although he had remarkt Diſpoſitions of Tenderneſs in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this fair Perſon, yet he dared not promiſe himſelf ſhe could deſire his Return; his Reaſon revolted againſt his Joy:</hi> How Unhappy a Wretch am I? <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I Adore the moſt Amiable of all Women, and yet I dare not offer to pleaſe her! ſhe has a Kindneſs for me, yet Honour and Friendſhip with-hold me from making the leaſt Advantage of it. What ſhall I do then, O Heavens! What ſhall I do! I flatter'd my ſelf, that Abſence would Cure me: Alas! this is a Remedy which I have fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly tried; I have never caſt mine Eyes on her Picture, but have found my ſelf more in Love, and more Miſerable than when I ſaw her every day. I muſt obey her, ſhe commands my Return; ſhe deſires to ſee me, and ſhe cannot be ignorant of my Paſſion: When I took my Leave of her, my Eyes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her the Secret of my Heart: And when I call to mind what I ſaw in hers, all my Reflections then are to no purpoſe; for I reſolve rather to die at her Feet, than to live remote from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He parted without any delay, and without taking leave of his Friends. He left a Gentleman to Excuſe him towards them, and to order his Affairs. He was in ſuch great haſte to ſee the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, that he uſed ſuch Diligence to be with her, that no body but he could have done: In arriving at</hi> Cagliary, <hi>Capital of</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne, <hi>he underſtood that the Marqueſs and his Wife were at a ſtately Country-houſe, where the Vice-Roy was gone to give them a Viſit, with all his Court. He learnt moreover, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs de</hi> Barbaran <hi>prepared for him a great Feaſt, where there were to be held Juſts or Turnaments, after the Ancient Manner of the</hi> Mores: <hi>He was the Defendant, and was to maintain,</hi> That a Husband beloved, is Happier than a Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Several Gentlemen that were not of this Opinion, were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves to go and diſpute the Prize, which the Marchioneſs, at the Vice-Queen's Intreaty, was to give to the Conquerour; 'Twas a Scarf embroidered with her own Hands, wrought with Cyphers: No one was to appear but maskt and diſguiſed, to the end all might be freer and more gallant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don Lewis <hi>had a ſecret Deſpight, in comprehending the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs ſo well ſatisfied:</hi> He is belov'd, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I cannot but look on him as my Rival, and as an Happy Rival; but we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſturb his Happineſs, in triumphing over his vain Glory. <hi>Having formed this Deſign, he would not appear in Town: he caus'd to be made a Suit of ſtrip'd Green Satin, embroidered with Gold, and all his Liveries were of the ſame Colour, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note his new hopes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:151523:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he entred into the Liſts, every body had their Eyes on him; his Magnificence and his Air gave Emulation to the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, and great Curioſities to the Ladies. The Marchioneſs felt a ſecret Emotion, of which ſhe could not diſcover the Cauſe: He was placed very near the Balcony, where ſhe ſate with the Vice-Queen; but there was no Lady there which did not loſe all her Luſtre near that of the Marchioneſs; her youthful Air, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not eighteen Years, her lovely white and red Cheeks, her Eyes ſo ſweet and graceful, her Scarlet and little Mouth, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Smiles, and her Shape, which ſurpaſt the Fairest, made her the Admiration of all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don Lewis <hi>was ſo raviſh'd in ſeeing her ſo charming, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve yet in her Countenance a languiſhing ſorrowful Air, that he flattered himſelf to have therein a part; and this was the firſt Moment wherein he thought himſelf Happy. When his turn came, he ran against the Marqueſs, and ſmote him ſo dexterouſly, that he got the Advantage all along of him: ſo that in a word, he gain'd the Prize with a general Applauſe, and with every one's good-liking. He threw himſelf at the Marchioneſs's Feet, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it at her Hands; he altered the Tone of his Voice, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her with his Mask on, low enough not to be heard but only by her:</hi> Divine Perſon, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> be pleas'd to obſerve what Fortune decides in favour of Lovers. <hi>He dar'd not ſay more to her; and without knowing him, ſhe gave him the Prize, with this natural Grace with which all her Actions were accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſuddenly withdrew himſelf, for fear of being known; for this might have been an occaſion of Quarrel between the Marqueſs and him; and without doubt he would not have eaſily pardon'd the Victory he obtain'd over him. This oblig'd, him to keep himſelf ſtill conceal'd for ſome Days. The Voice-Roy and his Lady return'd to</hi> Cagliary, <hi>and the Marqueſs and Marchioneſs accompanied them thither, with the whole Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don Lewis <hi>then ſhew'd himſelf; he pretended he juſt then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, and made as if he knew not what had past in the Field. The Marqueſs</hi> de Barbaran <hi>was tranſported with Joy in ſeeing him; and Abſence had not at all altered the Affection he had for this dear Relation. He had no difficult task to find a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble moment wherein to entertain his amiable Marchioneſs; he had as much liberty in their Lodgings as in his own; and you may well judge, Madam, that he forgot not to mention the Prize he had receiv'd from her fair Hands:</hi> How wretched am I, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> that you did not know me? Alas, Madam, I flattered my ſelf, that by ſome ſecret Pre-ſentiments you would learn,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151523:17"/> that no one but I could ſuſtain with ſuch Paſſion the Cauſe of Lovers againſt Husbands. No my Lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him, with an Angry and Diſdainful Air, to take away all Hope from him,</hi> I could never have imagin'd that you could have been Patron of ſo foul a Cauſe; and I could not have believ'd you could have taken ſuch ſtrong Engagements at <hi>Naples,</hi> that you ſhould come as far as <hi>Sardagne</hi> to Triumph over a Friend who maintain'd my Intereſts as well as his own. I ſhall die with Regret, Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Don Lewis, if I have diſpleas'd you in what I have done; and were you more favourably diſpoſed, and I might dare to make you my Confident, it would be no hard matter for me to perſwade you, that it is not at <hi>Naples</hi> I have left the Object of my Vows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Marchioneſs apprehending leſt he ſhould ſpeak more than ſhe was willing to hear, and appear livelily toucht with the Reproach ſhe made him, ſhe put on a more pleaſing Countenance, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Converſation into a Tone of Raillery, anſwer'd him,</hi> He took too ſeriouſly what ſhe had ſaid to him. <hi>He dared not make uſe of this occaſion to declare his Love to her; for though he lov'd her above all things, yet he reſpected her no leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he had left her, he began to blame himſelf for his Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> Shall I, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> always ſuffer without ſeeking any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy! <hi>It was ſome time before he could meet with a favourable occaſion, becauſe the Marchioneſs studiouſly avoided him; but being come one Night where ſhe was, he found her alone in an inward Room, lying on a Bed in a most lovely manner, and moſt becoming <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndreſs, her Hair being faſtned with Knots of Diamonds, hung careleſly about her Breaſts: The Trouble ſhe felt in ſeeing</hi> Don Lewis, <hi>appear'd on her Countenance, and rendred her yet more lovely: He drew near her with an Awful and reſpectful Air, fell down on his Knees by her; he lookt on her for ſome time, not daring to ſpeak but becoming a little more bold,</hi> If you conſider, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> the pitious Condition whereunto you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me, you will eaſily comprehend that it is no longer in my power to keep Silence: I could not avoid ſuch inevitable Stroaks as you have given me; I have adored you as ſoon as I ſaw you: I have endeavour'd to Cure my ſelf in flying from you; I have offered the greateſt Violence to my ſelf, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to maſter my Paſſion. You have recall'd me, Madam, from my Voluntary Exile, and I die a thouſand times a Day, uncertain of my Deſtiny: If you be Cruel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to refuſe me your Pity, ſuffer at leaſt, that having made known to you my Paſſion, I may die with Grief at your Feet. <hi>The Marchioneſs was ſome time without reſolving to anſwer

What do you then, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>anſwer'd he, interrupting her, being full of Grief and Deſpair,</hi> when you pronounce the Sentence of my Death? You cannot Hate, me ſay you: Do you not Hate me, and do you not do me all the Miſchief you are able, when you reſolve to avoid me? Make an end, Madam, make an end, leave not your Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance imperfect; ſacrifice me to your Duty, and your Husband; for my Life cannot but be odious, if you take from me the Hopes of pleaſing you. <hi>She lookt on him at this inſtant with Eyes full of Languiſhing: Don Lewis, ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me with what I would deſerve. <hi>In ending theſe words, ſhe aroſe, fearing greatly, leſt her Affection ſhould triumph over her Reaſon; and notwithſtanding his endeavours to with-hold her, ſhe paſt into a Chamber where her Women were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She thought ſhe had gained much on her ſelf in forcing her way out of this Converſation, without anſwering ſo favourably as her Heart could have wiſht; but Love is a Seducer, which muſt not be in any ſort hearkened to, if one will not be totally overcome by him. From that day</hi> Don Lewis <hi>began to think himſelf Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, though he wanted many things to compleat his Felicity. The Marchioneſs, in effect, had a Principle of Vertue, which oppoſed it ſelf always with Succeſs to the deſires of her Lover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He had no longer thoſe Scruples of Friendſhip for the Marqueſs</hi> de Barbaran <hi>which had ſo greatly disturbed his Mind; Love had perfectly baniſht Friendſhip; nay, he even ſecretly hated him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine,</hi> Don Lewis <hi>flattering himſelf, that perhaps he might find a favourable moment to affect the Marchioneſs's Heart with ſome Pity; he carefully ſought it; and to find it, one day when 'twas very hot, knowing that the Marchioneſs was wont to retire to Repoſe her ſelf after Dinner, as it is cuſtomary, in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he came to her, doubting not but every body was aſleep in the Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She was in a Ground-Room which lookt into the Garden; all was faſt and ſhut cloſe, ſave a little Window, whereby he ſaw on her Bed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151523:18"/> this Charming Creature: She was in a profound Sleep, half un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt; he had the time to diſcover ſuch Beauties as ſtill augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the force of his Paſſion. He approacht ſo ſoftly to her, that ſhe did not awake: It was already ſome moments that he had lookt on her with all the Tranſports of a Man amazed, when ſeeing her naked Breaſts, he could not forbear kiſſing them. She aroſe on a ſudden; ſhe had not her Eyes open; the Chamber was dark, and ſhe could never have believ'd</hi> Don Lewis <hi>could have been ſo bold. I have already told you, Madam, that he reſembled the Marqueſs</hi> de Barbaran; <hi>She did not doubt then but it was he, and calling him ſeveral times,</hi> her dear Marqueſs and Husband <hi>ſhe tenderly embrac'd him. He well knew his Error; whatever Pleaſure it procured him, he could have wiſhed to have ow'd this only to his Miſtreſs's Favours. But, O Heavens, how unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately it hapned! The Marqueſs came in this dangerous moment; and 'twas not without the greatest fury he ſaw the Liberty</hi> Don Lewis <hi>took with his Wife. At the noiſe he had made in entring, ſhe had turn'd her Eyes towards the Door, and ſeeing her Husband enter, whom ſhe thought ſhe had already in her Arms, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to repreſent her Affliction and Aſtoniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don Lewis <hi>amaz'd at this Accident, flatter'd himſelf, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he was not known: He paſt immediately into the Gallery, and finding a Window was opened into the Garden, he threw himſelf out of it, and immediately paſt through a Back-door. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs purſued him, without being able to overtake him: In return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame way he came, he unhappily found the Marchioneſs's Picture. which</hi> Don Lewis <hi>had dropt as he ran; he immediately made moſt cruel Reflections hereupon: This Picture of his Wife, which</hi> Don Lewis <hi>had let fall, and the ſight of her embracing him, all this made him no longer doubt of his Wives Falſhood:</hi> I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, <hi>Cry'd he,</hi> by her whom I loved dearer than my own Life: Was there ever a more Unhappy Man in the World? <hi>In ending theſe Words, he returned to his Wives Chamber. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately threw her ſelf at his Feet, and melting into Tears, would have juſtify'd her ſelf, and make known to him her Innocency; but the Spirit of Jealouſie had ſo fully poſſeſt him, that he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently represt her: He harkned only to the Tranſports of his Rage and Deſpair, and turning away his Eyes, that he might not ſee ſo lovely an Object, he had the Barbarity to strike his Dagger into the Breast of the moſt Beautiful and most Vertuous Woman in the World. She offered her ſelf to be ſlaughtered as an innocent Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and her Soul iſſued out in a ſtream of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O God, <hi>cryed I,</hi> O Imprudent <hi>Don Lewis!</hi> Why did you leave this Charming Lady to the Fury of an Amorous Husband,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151523:19"/> tranſported with Jealouſie! You might have ſnatch'd her out of his cruel Hands. Alas, Madam, <hi>replied this Gentleman,</hi> he knew not what he did; for what would he have done at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time to have prevented ſuch a Misfortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As ſoon as the unfortunate Marchioneſs had rendred her laſt Breath, her cruel Executioner ſhut her Apartment, took all the Money and Jewels he had, mounted on Horſe-back, and fled with all the ſpeed he could.</hi> Don Lewis <hi>reſtleſs, and more Amorous than ever, returned thither in the Evening, notwithstanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might befal him: He was ſurpriz'd when he was told the Marchioneſs was ſtill aſleep; he immediately went into the Garden, and entred into the Gallery, through the ſame Window which he had found open, and from thence came into the Chamber: 'Twas ſo dark, that he was fain to walk warily; when he felt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which had like to have made him fall, he stooped down and found it was a dead Body; he uttered a great Shriek, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not but it was that of his dear Mistreſs, he ſunk down with Grief: Some of the Marchioneſs's Women walking under the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of her apartment, heard</hi> Don-Lewis<hi>'s Crys; they eaſily got up through the ſame Window, and entred the Room. What a ſad Spectacle, what a lamentable ſight was this? I cannot find Words to denote to you the Horror of this Spectacle,</hi> Don Lewis <hi>was no ſooner come to himſelf, by the force of Remedies, but his Grief, Rage and Deſpair, broke out with ſuch Violence, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to calm him; and I am perſwaded he had not out-lived her whoſe loſs he occaſioned, if the deſire of Vengeance had not re-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He parted like one furious in ſearch of the Marqueſs</hi> de Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran; <hi>He ſought him every-where without hearing any news of him; He ran over</hi> Italy, <hi>traverſt</hi> Germany, <hi>came into</hi> Flanders, <hi>and paſt into</hi> France. <hi>He was told that the Marqueſs was at</hi> Valentia <hi>in</hi> Spain; <hi>he came there, and met not with him. In fine, three Years being paſt, without finding the means of ſacrificing his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his Miſtreſs's Ghoſt, Divine Grace, which is irreſiſtible, and particularly on great Souls, toucht his ſo efficatiouſly, that he immediately changed his Deſire of Revenge into ſerious Deſires of leaving the World, and minding only the fitting himſelf for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being fill'd with this Spirit he return'd into</hi> Sardagnia: <hi>He ſold all his Eſtate, which he diſtributed among ſome of his Friends, who with great Merit were yet very poor; and by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo poor himſelf, that he reduced himſelf to the begging of Alms.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:151523:19"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>He had heretofore ſeen, in going to</hi> Madrid, <hi>a place very fit to make an Hermitage, (it is towards</hi> Mount Dragon;) <hi>this Mountain is almoſt inacceſſible, and you cannot paſs to it but through an Overture, which is in the midst of a great Rock; it is ſtopt up when the Snow falls, and the Hermitage lies buried more than ſix Months under it.</hi> Don Lewis <hi>made one be built here, where he was wont to paſs whole Years without ſeeing any one. He made ſuch Proviſions as were neceſſary, having good Books, and thus remain'd in this diſmal Solitude; but this Year his Friends forced him hither, by reaſon of a great Sickneſs, which had like to have cost him his Life. It is four Years ſince he has led this Holy Spiritual Life, and ſo different from that to which he was born, that it is with great trouble he ſees any of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Marqueſs</hi> de Barbaran, <hi>he has wholly left the Iſle of</hi> Sardagnia, <hi>where he has not the Liberty to return. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd he is married again at</hi> Anvers, <hi>to a Widow of a</hi> Spaniard <hi>named</hi> Fonceca.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is he himſelf that has related to one of my Friends the Particularities of his Crime; and he is ſo furiouſly tortured with the remembrance of it, that he imagines he continually ſees his Wife dying, and reproaching him with his Fury and Jealouſie. In a word, he has contracted ſuch a deep Melancholy, that his Death is thought by every one to be near, or at the leaſt, the loſs of his Sences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman here was ſilent; and I not being able to forbear weeping at ſo Tragical a Relation, <hi>Don Fernand de To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> who had obſerv'd it, and would not take notice of it, for fear of interrupting the Relation, rally'd me about my Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, telling me how well he was pleaſed to find me ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, and that I ſhould not be long before I met with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects fit to exerciſe it on. I did not ſo much mind the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Anſwer to him, as the Thanking this Gentleman, who was pleas'd to entertain me with the Recital of ſo extraordinary an Adventure: I intreated him to make my Compliments to <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and to give him from me two Piſtols, ſeeing he lived on Alms. <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and each of the Cavaliers, gave as much: <hi>Here is,</hi> ſaid the Gentleman to us, <hi>wherewith to enrich the Poor of</hi> Victoria; <hi>for</hi> Don Lewis <hi>appropriates not ſuch great Charities as theſe to himſelf.</hi> We told him, he was the Maſter, and might diſpoſe of the Money as he pleaſed. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Adventures:</p>
               <p>Although I had a Paſport from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the beſt ſpecified, and moſt general, as is poſſible, yet I was oblig'd to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151523:20"/> take a Billet from the Toll-Houſe; for without this Precaution, all my Cloaths had been confiſcated: <hi>To what purpoſe then is my Paſport?</hi> ſaid I to them. <hi>To none at all,</hi> replied they. The Surveyers and Officers of the Cuſtoms would not ſo much as caſt their Eyes on it; they told me, The King muſt come and aſſure them, that this Order was from him. It is to no purpoſe for any one to alledge his being a Stranger, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Uſages of the Country: For they drily anſwer, <hi>That the Stranger's Ignorance makes the</hi> Spaniard<hi>'s Profit.</hi> The ill weather has kept me here two Days, during which I ſaw the Governeſs, and the Play. The principal Place of this Town is adorn'd with a very fair Fountain ſtanding in the midſt: it is incircled with the Town-Houſe, the Priſon, two Convents, and ſeveral well-built Houſes: Here is a New Town and an Old one; every body forſakes this latter to dwell in the other. Here are very rich Merchants; their chief Trade is at St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> or <hi>Bilbo;</hi> they ſend great ſtore of Iron to <hi>Grenada, Estre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madour, Galicia,</hi> and other Parts of the Kingdom. I obſerv'd, that the great Streets are ſet with fine Trees, which are water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Streams running by them. From <hi>Mount St. Adrian</hi> hither, it is ſeven Leagues. In fine, I am juſt ſetting out, and muſt end this long Letter; it is late, and I have ſpoke, to you ſo much of what I have ſeen, that I have ſaid nothing of my Affections to you: Believe me, however, Dear Coſin, that I am, and ever ſhall be.</p>

               <p>MY Letters are ſo long, that it is hard to believe when I finiſh them, that I have any thing elſe more to tell you; yet, my dear Coſin, I never cloſe any, but there remains ſtill ſufficient for another: When I were only to ſpeak to you of my Friendſhip, this would be an inexhauſtible Subject; you may make ſome Judgment of it from the Pleaſure I find in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Commands. You are deſirous to know all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of my Voyage, I will therefore go on to relate them:</p>
               <p>I ſet out very late from <hi>Victoria,</hi> by reaſon of my ſtay at the Governeſs's, whom I before mention'd: and we went to lie at
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151523:20"/> 
                  <hi>Miranda;</hi> the Country is very pleaſant as far as <hi>Avigny;</hi> we came afterwerds by a difficult Way to the Banks of the River <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rola,</hi> whoſe. Noiſe is the greater, in that 'tis full of Rocks, on which the Water daſhes, beats up, and falls down, and forms natural Caſcades in ſeveral places: We continu'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the high Mountains of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> where we ran a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeveral Dangers: we ſaw the ancient Ruines of an old Caſtle, where Ghoſts and Spirits have their Apartments, as well as in that of <hi>Quebara,</hi> it is near <hi>Gargaſon;</hi> and being to ſtop there to ſhew my Paſport, becauſe here certain Cuſtoms are paid to the King, I learnt from the Alcade of the Borough, who drew near my Litter to talk with me, that it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Report of the Country, That there were formerly a King and a Queen here, who had ſo fine and beautiful a Woman to their Daughter, that ſhe was rather taken for a Goodneſs than a Mortal Creature: ſhe was call'd <hi>Mira;</hi> and it is from her Name came the <hi>Mira</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>Look you;</hi> for as ſoon as ever ſhe appear'd, all the People attentively beheld her; and cried out, <hi>Mira, Mira;</hi> and here's the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of a Word drawn far enough. This Princeſs was never ſeen by any Body who became not deſperately in love with her; but her Diſdainfulneſs and Indifference made all her Lovers pine away: The famous Baſilisk never kill'd ſo many People as the Beautiful and Dreadful <hi>Mira;</hi> ſhe thus depopulated her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdom, and all the Countries thereabouts were full of the deceaſed and dying Lovers. After they had in vain Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt themſelves to her, they laſtly applied themſelves to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to demand Vengeance on her Cruelty: The Gods at length grew Angry, and the Goddeſſes were not much behind them in the Exerciſe of this Paſſion: ſo that to puniſh her, the Scourges of Heaven finiſh'd the Deſtruction of her Father's Kingdom: In this general Calamity he conſulted the Oracle, which told him, <hi>That all theſe Miſeries would not have an end, till</hi> Maria <hi>had expiated the Miſchiefs which her Eyes had done: and that ſhe muſt be gone: That Deſtiny would conduct her to the place where ſhe was to loſe her repoſe and liberty.</hi> The Princeſs obey'd, believing it impoſſible for her to be touch'd with Tenderneſs: She carried only her Nurſe with her; ſhe was clad like a ſimple Shepherdeſs, leſt ſhe ſhould be taken notice of, whether at Sea or Land. She ran over a great Part of the World, committing every day two or three Dozen of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for her Beauty was not diminiſht by the Fatigue of her Travels: She arriv'd at length near this old Caſtle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to a young Count, call'd <hi>Nios,</hi> endowed with a thouſand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151523:21"/> Perfections, but extream Proud and Reſerv'd: he ſpent his time in the Woods; as ſoon as ever he perceiv'd a Woman, he fled from her, and of all things he ſaw in the World, ſhe was his greateſt Averſion. The beautiful <hi>Mira</hi> was reſting her ſelf one day under the ſhade of ſome Trees, when <hi>Nios</hi> paſt by, cloathed with a Lyon's Skin, a Bow at his Girdle, and a Mace on his Shoulder; his Hair was all clotted together, and his Face be ſmear'd like a Chimney-Sweeper's, (this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is obſervable) yet the Princeſs thought him the moſt handſome Man in the World; ſhe ran after him as if ſhe had been mad; and he ran from her as if he had been in the ſame condition: ſhe loſt the ſight of him; ſhe knew not where to find him: ſhe is now in the greataſt Sorrow, weeping Day and Night with her Nurſe. <hi>Nios</hi> return'd to the Chaſe; ſhe ſaw him again, and would have follow'd him: as ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd her, he did as at firſt, and <hi>Mira</hi> betook her ſelf again to her Lamentations; but her Paſſion giving her new ſtrength, ſhe out-ran him, ſtopt him, taking hold of his Locks, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to look on her, thinking this was enough to engage him: He caſt his Eyes on her with as much Indifference as if ſhe had been an ordinary Perſon. Never Woman was more ſurpriz'd; ſhe would not leave him; ſhe came maugre him to his Caſtle: where, as ſoon as ſhe had entred, he there left her, and was no more ſeen. The poor <hi>Mira,</hi> being not to be comforted, died with Grief, And from that time you hear deep Sighs and Groans, which come from the Caſtle of <hi>Nios.</hi> The young Wenches of the Country are uſed to go there, and carry her little Preſents of Fruits and Milk, which they ſet down at the Mouth of a Cave, where no body dare enter: they ſaid, this was to comfort her; but this has been aboliſht as ſuperſtitious. And though I believed not a word of whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was told me at <hi>Garganſon,</hi> in relation to <hi>Mira</hi> and <hi>Nios,</hi> yet I was pleas'd in the Recital of this Story, of which I omit a thouſand Particulars, for fear of tiring you by its length. My Waiting-woman was ſo affected with this Relation, that ſhe was for having us return back again, to ſet at the Mouth of the Cave ſome red Partridges, which my People had brought: ſhe imagin'd the Princeſs's Ghoſt would be mightily comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in receiving this Teſtimony of our good Will; but for my part, I thought I ſhould be more content than her, in having thoſe Partridges for my Supper. We paſt the River of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rola,</hi> on a great ſtone-Bridge, and having went over another, with difficulty enough, by reaſon of the melted Snow, we arriv'd at <hi>Miranda d' Ebro;</hi> this is a great Village, or a little Town:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151523:21"/> here is a large place adorn'd with a Fountain; the River <hi>Ebro,</hi> which is one of the moſt conſiderable of <hi>Spain,</hi> traverſes it: You ſee on the Top of a Mountain the Caſtle, with ſeveral Towers; it appears to be of ſome ſtrength; and there iſſues out ſo great a Stream from a Rock on which it is built, that it turns ſeveral Mills: I could not obſerve any thing elſe worth writing to you.</p>
               <p>The three Knights I ſpake of to you, were arriv'd before me, and giv'n all requiſite Orders for Supper; ſo we eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And tho' the Night appear'd well advanced, becauſe the Days are ſhort in this Seaſon, yet 'twas not late; ſo that theſe Gentlemen, who ſhew'd me great Reſpect and Civility, askt me, How I would paſs the time? I propoſed to them the playing at <hi>Ombre,</hi> and that I would go Halves with <hi>Don Fernand de Toledo.</hi> They accepted the Offer: <hi>Don Fernand de Cardonne</hi> ſaid, He had rather Converſe with me than Play: ſo the three others began, and I for ſome time gave my ſelf over to the looking on them, with great Pleaſure, for their Way is quite different from ours: They never utter a word; I do not ſay, to complain, (for this would be unworthy the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gravity) but to demand a <hi>Gano,</hi> or to cut higher, or to ſhew that one may take ſome other Advantage: In a word, they ſeem to be Statues, or Pieces of <hi>German</hi> Clock-work, never appearing tranſported with either good or bad Luck. Among other Diſcourſe which I had with <hi>D. Fred. de Cardonne,</hi> he told me, There were two obſervable things in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> one of which is a Mountain of Salt, partly white as Snow, and the other part clearer and more tranſparent than Cryſtal: that there is Blue, Green, Violet, Orange, and a thouſand different Colours, which yet loſes its tincture when wetted; it continually forms it ſelf, and grows there: and though commonly the places where Salt is to be found, are ſo barren, that you ſee not ſo much as an Herb, yet there are here Pine-Trees of great height, and excellent Vine-yards: When the Sun darts its Rays on this Mountain, it looks as if it wholly conſiſted of the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones in the World: but the beſt of it is, that it yields a good Revenue.</p>
               <p>The other Particular he mentioned to me, was of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whoſe Water is very good, and of the ſame Colour as Claret: <hi>I have never heard any thing of this,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>but one of my Relations, who has been in</hi> Catalonia, <hi>has aſſured me there is a Fountain near</hi> Balut, <hi>whoſe Water is as others are for Colour, and yet whatever you put therein, appears like Gold. I have ſeen it, Madam,</hi> continued <hi>Don Frederic; and I remember
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151523:22"/> a Man that was very covetous, and more fooliſh, went thither every Day to put therein his Silver, hoping in time 'twould be chang'd into Gold: but he was ſo far from enriching himſelf that he was ruin'd; for ſome Peaſants, more ſubtle and crafty than he, having perceived what he did, ſtood watching a little lower, and the Stream of the Water would now and then bring ſome Pieces to them. If you return into</hi> France <hi>by</hi> Catalonia, added he, <hi>you will ſee this Fountain, It is not that which can draw me thither,</hi> reply'd I, <hi>but the deſire of paſſing by</hi> Montferat, <hi>wou'd make me undertake a longer Journey. It is ſituated,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>near</hi> Barcelona, <hi>and is a place of great Devotion: It ſeems as if the Rock were ſawed through the middle; the Church ſtands high, is ſmall and obſcure. By the help of Fourſcore and Ten Lamps of Silver, you perceive the Image of the Virgin, which looks very duskiſh, and is held for Miraculous. The Altar coſt</hi> Philip <hi>the Second thirty thouſand Crowns; and here is every Day ſeen Pilgrims from all Parts of the World; this Holy Place abounds with Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages, inhabited by Perſons of great Devotion: Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Men of good Birth, who have not left the World till they have well tryed it, and who appear much taken with the Sweets of their Retirements, though the Place be diſmal; and 'twould been impoſſible to have had Acceſs to it, had not a Paſſage been cut through the Rocks. Yet you find here ſeveral agreeable Objects, a curious Proſpect, various Springs, Gardens well dreſt by theſe Religioſes own hands, and every where a certain Air of Solitude and Devotion, which mightily affects thoſe who come there. We have another famous place of Devotion,</hi> added he, <hi>and that is</hi> Nueſtra Senora del Pilar: <hi>it is at</hi> Saragoſſa, <hi>in a Chappel on a Pillar of Marble, where our Lady holds the Babe Jeſus in her Arms. It is pretended, that the Virgin appeared on this ſame Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to St.</hi> James; <hi>and the Image is here worſhipt with great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. It cannot be well obſerv'd, becauſe it ſtands ſo high, and in a very dark place; ſo that without the Flambeaux it could not be ſeen at all. Here are always Fifty Lamps burning; Gold and precious Stones ſhine here on all ſides; and the Pilgrims come here in great Sholes. But yet,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I may truly ſay, in favour of</hi> Saragoſſa <hi>that 'tis one of the fineſt Towns you ſhall ſee; it is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted along the</hi> Ebre, <hi>in a vaſt Field, is adorn'd with great Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, rich Churches, a ſtately Bridge, fine open Places, and the moſt charming Women in the World, who love</hi> French, <hi>and will omit nothing to oblige you to ſpeak well of 'em, if you paſs by there.</hi> I told him, I had already heard ſeveral things ſpoken of them to their commendation: <hi>But</hi> continu'd I, <hi>this Country is very Barren, and the Souldiers can hardly ſubſiſt in it. In effect,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151523:22"/> he, <hi>whether the Air be bad, or that they want Neceſſaries, the</hi> Flemmings <hi>and</hi> Germans <hi>cannot live there? and if they do not die there, 'tis becauſe they run away. The</hi> Spaniards <hi>and</hi> Neopolitans <hi>are more prone than they to deſert; theſe laſt paſt through</hi> France, <hi>to return into their Country; the others Coast the</hi> Pyrences <hi>along</hi> Languedoc, <hi>and enter</hi> Caſtille <hi>by</hi> Navarre, <hi>or</hi> Biſcaye. <hi>This is a Courſe which the old Souldiers fail not to ſteer; for the new-rais'd ones, they periſh in</hi> Catalonia, <hi>being not accuſtomed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and 'tis certain there's no place where War is more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the King of</hi> Spain: <hi>He maintains his Forces here with great Charge, and the Advantage which the Enemy gains of him is not ſmall; and I very well know they are more ſenſible at</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid <hi>for the ſmalleſt Loſs in</hi> Catalonia, <hi>than they would be for the greateſt in</hi> Flanders, <hi>or</hi> Milan, <hi>or elſe-where. But at preſent,</hi> continues he, <hi>we are going to be more at our Eaſe than we have been, being expected at Court, that the Peace will be laſting, becauſe they talk much of a Marriage which will make a new Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance; and the Marqueſs</hi> de Los Balbares, <hi>Penipotentiary at</hi> Nimiguen, <hi>has receiv'd Orders to paſs ſpeedily to</hi> France, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that King,</hi> Mademoiſelle d' Orleans; <hi>therefore it is not doubted but the Marriage will be concluded: But it is thought very strange,</hi> Don John <hi>of</hi> Auſtria <hi>ſhould conſent to this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. You will do me a ſingular Pleaſure,</hi> ſaid I, interrupting him, <hi>if you would inform me of ſome Particularities touching this Prince: It is natural for to have a Curioſity in relation to Perſons of this Character; and when a body comes into a Court where one was never before, that I may not appear a Novice, I ſhould have ſome previous Notices.</hi> He anſwered me, It would be a great ſatisfaction to him, if he could relate any thing might pleaſe me; and he began thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will not, perhaps, Madam, think it amiſs, that I begin at the Original of Things, and tell you, That this Prince was Son of one of the fineſt Women in</hi> Spain, <hi>named</hi> Maria Calderona; <hi>ſhe was a Player; and the Duke</hi> de Medina de las Torres, <hi>became deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in love with her: This Cavalier had ſo many Advantages above others, that</hi> Calderonna <hi>lov'd him no leſs than ſhe was beloved by him. In the Heat of this Intrigue,</hi> Philip <hi>the Fourth ſaw her, and preferr'd her to one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, and who was ſo griev'd at this Change of the King, whom ſhe really loved, and had a Son by, that ſhe retired from the World, and betook her ſelf to</hi> Los del Calſas Reales, <hi>where ſhe put on the Religio's Habit. As for</hi> Calderonne, <hi>her inclination lying wholly towards the Duke</hi> de Medina, <hi>ſhe would not hearken to the King, without the Duke would thereto conſent: She ſpake to him of it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151523:23"/> and offered to withdraw ſecretly where he would; but the Duke fearing to incur the King's Diſpleaſure, anſwer'd her, He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to yield up to His Majeſty a Treaſure which he was not in a Capacity to contend for. She made him a thouſand Reproaches for this; ſhe call'd him Traytor to his Love, ingrateful towards his Miſtreſs: And more-over, told him, That though he was ſo Happy as that he could diſpoſe of his Heart as he pleaſed, yet ſhe could not do the ſame; and therefore he muſt continue to viſit her, or prepare to ſee her die with Deſpair. The Duke affected with ſo great a Paſſion, promiſed to feign a Journey to</hi> Andalouſia, <hi>and to remain with her hid in a Cloſet: he effectually parted from the Court, and afterwards ſhut himſelf up (as it was agreed) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Riſque he ran by ſo imprudent Conduct. The King, in the mean time, was very Amorous, and remain'd very well ſatisfi'd: She had, during this,</hi> Don John d' Auſtria, <hi>and the Reſemblance he had with the Duke</hi> de Medina de Las Torres, <hi>had made it be thought that he was his Son; but tho' the King had other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and particularly the Biſhop of</hi> Malaga, <hi>good Fortune decided in his Favour, and he has been only acknowledg'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don John<hi>'s Friends ſay, That 'twas by reaſon of the Exchange which had been made of the Son of</hi> Calderonna, <hi>for the Son of Queen</hi> Elizabeth; <hi>and here's how they ſet forth this Change, which is a Story made on purpoſe to impoſe on the World, and which I believe has no ground of Truth: They pretend, the King being deſperately in love with this Player, ſhe became big with Child at the ſame time as the Queen; and ſeeing the King's Paſſion was ſo greatly towards her, that ſhe might expect any thing, ſhe ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that ſhe made him promiſe her, That if the Queen had a Son, and ſhe likewiſe, he ſhould put hers in his place:</hi> What will you loſe by this, Sir? <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> Will it not be your Son that will ſtill Reign, only with this difference, that loving me, as you ſay you do, you will love him likewiſe the better. <hi>She had Wit, and the King could deny her nothing; he conſented, and in effect the Buſineſs was manag'd with that Addreſs, that the Queen being brought to Bed of a Son, and</hi> Calderonna <hi>of another, the Exchange was made. He that ſhould have Reign'd, and who bore the Name of</hi> Baltazar, <hi>died at the Age of fourteen Years: The King was told, 'twas with over-heating himſelf at Tennis; but the truth is, this Prince was ſuffered to keep bad Company, which procured him his Misfortunes; it is ſaid likewiſe, That</hi> Don Pedro d' Arragon, <hi>his Governour, and Chief Gentleman of his Chamber, more contributed to this than any other, ſuffering him to bring into his Apartment a Woman he lov'd; after this he was taken with a violent Feaver, and conceal'd the Occaſion: The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151523:23"/> Phyſicians, who were ignorant of it, thought to eaſe him by frequent Bleedings, which put an end to what ſtrength he had; and by this means they ended his Life. The King knowing, but too late, what had hapn'd, baniſht</hi> Don Pedro <hi>for not hindring this Exceſs, or for not having timely diſcover'd it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the mean time</hi> Don John <hi>of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>who was brought up as the Natural Son, chang'd not his Condition, though this ought to have been, had he been indeed the lawful Son; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, his Creatures affirm, He ſo exactly reſembles Q.</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, <hi>that ſhe needs no other Picture of her Likeneſs. And this Opinion fails not of gaining Belief with the People, who run vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently after Novelties, and who ſo paſſionately loved this great Queen, that they bewail her ſtill as if ſhe was but now deceas'd. It is true, that if</hi> Don John <hi>of</hi> Auſtria <hi>would make his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the favourable Diſpoſitions of the People, he has met with ſeveral Opportunities of extending his Fortune very far; but his only Aim is to ſerve the King, and to keep his Subjects in thoſe Sentiments of Fidelity they ought to have for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To return to</hi> Calderonna: <hi>The King ſurpriſed one day the Duke</hi> de Medina <hi>with her, and in the exceſs of his Rage, he ran to him with his Poynard in his Hand; he was about to kill him, when this Woman placed her ſelf between, telling him, He might ſtrike her if he would. Having the moſt extream Paſſion for her, he could not but Pardon him, contenting himſelf only with baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: But underſtanding ſhe continu'd to love him, and write to him, he ſtudied only how to get a new Paſſion; when he had one ſtrong enough not to apprehend the Charms of</hi> Calderonna, <hi>he ſent word to her to retire into a Monaſtery, as is cuſtomary when the King forſakes his Mistreſs. She put it not off, writing a Letter to the Duke, to bid him Adieu: And ſhe receiv'd the Veil of a Religio from the Hand of the Apoſtolick Nuncio, who became ſince</hi> Innocent X. <hi>It is very likely the King believ'd</hi> Don John <hi>was his real Son, ſeeing he loved him ſo dearly: One thing will appear to you very ſingular, which is, that a King of</hi> Spain <hi>having Natural Sons owned by him, they never entred</hi> Madrid <hi>during his Life: So</hi> Don John <hi>was brought up at</hi> Ocanna, <hi>which is ſome Leagues diſtant from it. The King, his Father, came oft thither, and he made him come even to the Gates of the Town, where he went to meet him. This Custom comes from that the Grandees of</hi> Spain <hi>diſpute the Rank which theſe Princes would hold.</hi> Don John, <hi>before he went into</hi> Catalonia, <hi>remain'd commonly at</hi> Buen Retiro, <hi>which is a Royal Seat, at one of the fartheſt parts of</hi> Madrid, <hi>a little without the Gate: And he ſhew'd himſelf ſo little, that he was never ſeen at any Publick
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151523:24"/> Feaſt during the Life of the late King: but ſince, Times have chang'd, and his Fortunes ſtand on a different bottom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whilſt the Queen,</hi> Maria Ann <hi>of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>Siſter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the King's Mother, Govern'd</hi> Spain; <hi>and her Son was not yet of Age to hold the Reigns of the State. She would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> Don John <hi>keep from the Court; and more-over, found her ſelf ſo capable of Governing, that ſhe had a mind to eaſe her Son for a long time of the Burden of Ruling. She was not troubled to ſee him ignorant of whatever might give a deſire of Reigning: but though ſhe brought the greateſt Precautions, to hinder him from feeling he was under too strict a Tutelage, and ſuffered no Perſons to come near him, but thoſe ſhe was well aſſured of; yet this hindred not but ſome of the King's Faithful Servants hazarded themſelves, by giving him to underſtand what he might do for his Liberty. He follow'd the Advice was given him; and in fine, having taken Meaſures accordingly, he stole away one Night, and went to</hi> Buen Retiro. <hi>He as ſoon ſent from thence an Order to the Queen his Mother, not to ſtir out of the Palace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don John <hi>is of a middle Stature, well ſhaped, Black, and lively Eyes, and a most Manly Countenance. He is Polite, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and very Brave. He is ignorant of nothing befitting his Birth, being well-verſt in all Arts and Sciences. He writes and ſpeaks very well five Languages, and underſtands yet more. He has for a long time ſtudied Judicial Aſtrology. There is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which he cannot make, and uſe with the beſt Maſters. He works on all kind of Mechanicks, makes Arms, and paints finely. He took a great Pleaſure in the Mathematicks; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charg'd with the Government of the State, he has been oblig'd to lay aſide all other Employments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He came to</hi> Buen-Retiro <hi>in the beginning of the Year</hi> 1677. <hi>and as ſoon as he was there, he ſent the Queen-Mother to</hi> Toledo, <hi>becauſe ſhe had declared againſt him, and hindred his return to the King.</hi> Don John <hi>had an extream Joy in receiving from the King's own Hand an Order to take Care of Every thing, and to manage the Affairs of the Kingdom: And 'twas not without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he diſcharg'd himſelf on him, ſeeing he then was ignorant of the Art of Reigning. It was alledg'd for a Reaſon of his ſlow Education, That the King his Father was dying when he gave him Life: That when he came into the World, they were fain to put him in a Box of Cotten, being ſo tender and ſmall, that he could not be ſwadled: That he was brought up in the Arms, and on the Knees of the Ladies of the Palace, till he was Ten Years old, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting his Foot once all this while on the Ground to walk: That in the Sequel the Queen his Mother, who was engaged by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:151523:24"/> all the Ties of Natural Duty to preſerve this only Heir of the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Branch, fearing to loſe him, dared not let him ſtudy, lest by two great an Application he ſhould loſe his Health, which in truth was very unſound: And 'twas obſerv'd, that the great Number of Women, with whom the King always was, and who too ſharply reprehended him for his Faults which he committed, had inſpired him with ſuch a great Averſion to them, that as ſoon as ever he had notice a Lady ſtaid for him in any place he was to paſs, he stole another way, or kept himſelf ſhut up all day in his Chamber. The Marchioneſs</hi> de Luz Veles, <hi>who was his Governeſs, told me, ſhe waited for an Opportunity full ſix Months to ſpeak with him, and when Chance had brought them vnavoidably to him, he took, their Requeſts from their Hands, but turn'd his Head another way, for fear he ſhould ſee them. His Health is ſince ſo increaſed, that his Marriage with the Arch-Dutcheſs, the Emperor's Daughter, having been broke off by</hi> Don John, <hi>by reaſon 'twas the Queen-Mothers Project, he has deſired to marry</hi> Mademoiſelled' Orleans. <hi>The Circumstances of the Peace which are lately concluded at</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miguen, <hi>made him caſt his Eyes towards this Princeſs, with whoſe excellent Qualities, Madam, you are better acquainted than I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is hard to believe, that having Diſpoſitions ſo far from Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, he ſhould become ſo ſuddenly and vehemently in love with the Queen, as he became on the only Rehearſal of her good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and at the ſight of her Picture in Minature, which was ſhew'd him. He never lets it go out of his Hand; he always holds it to his Heart; He Dialogues with it ſo prettily, as aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes all the Courtiers; for he ſpeaks a Language he never ſpoke: His Paſſion for the Princeſs furniſhes him with a thouſand Thoughts, which he dares not entruſt any body with. He thinks no body makes haste enough; and therefore ſends freſh Curriers every day to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Billets</hi> doux, <hi>and bring hack News of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When you come to</hi> Madrid, added he, <hi>you will hear, Madam, ſeveral Particulars which have without doubt hapned ſince I was there, and which will perhaps more ſatisfie your Curioſity than what I have related to you.</hi> I am very much oblig'd to you, <hi>anſwered I,</hi> for your Civilities; but do me the Favour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me farther, in giving me the true Character of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> You know them, and I am perſwaded nothing has eſcap'd your Enquiries; You ſpeaking to me without Paſſion and Intereſt, I may reckon my ſelf ſure of what you tell me. <hi>Why believe you, Madam,</hi> replied he ſmiling, <hi>that I ſhall ſpeak to you more ſincerely than another? There are Reaſons which may render me ſuſpected: They are my Maſters; I muſt manage them;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151523:25"/> And if I be not Politick enough to do it, the Vexation of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to obey them, would tempt me to entertain Notions in their Reſpect contrary to Truth.</hi> However it be, <hi>ſaid I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him,</hi> pray tell me what you know of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Spaniards, ſaid he, <hi>have always paſt for Fierce and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: This Glory is mixt with Gravity; and they carry it ſo far, that one may call it an extravagant Pride: They are Brave, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Raſh; yet they are accuſed for not being daring enough; They are Cholerick, Revengeful, without ſhewing any Tranſport, Liberal without Ostentation, Sober in their Diet, very Preſumtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Proſperity, too Rampant in Adverſity: They Idolize Women; they are ſo prepoſſeſt in their Favour, that they ſhew no Diſcretion in the Choice of their Wives: They are Patient to Exceſs, Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Idle, Singular, Philoſophiſers: And as to the rest, Men of Honour, keeping their Words, tho' it coſt 'em their Lives. They have a great deal of Wit and Vivacity, eaſily comprehend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves in the ſame manner, and in few Words; They are Prudent, Jealous without meaſure, Diſintereſted, bad Oeconomiſts, Cloſe, Superſtitious, great Catholicks, at leaſt in appearance: They are good Poets, and write Verſes with great Facility. They would be capable of Nobler Sciences, would they vouchſafe to apply themſelves thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have a Greatneſs of Soul, Elevated Wit, Conſtancy, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seriouſneſs, and a Reſpect for Ladies, as is not ſeen elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: They have a Set-Behaviour, full of Affectation, intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their own Merit, hardly ever in this Particular doing Right to that of others. Their Bravery conſiſts in ſtanding Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly on the Defenſive Part, without giving Ground, and without dreading Danger; but they love not to ſeek it, which proceeds from their great Judgment: They diſcern Danger, and avoid it. Their greatest Defect, in my Opinion, is the Paſſion of Revenge and the Means they uſe for this: Their Maxims hereupon are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely oppoſite to Chriſtianity and Honour: When they have receiv'd an Affront, they make him be Aſſaſſinated who has offered it. They are not contented with this; for they cauſe them to be Aſſaſſinated likewiſe whom they have offended, in the Apprehention of being prevented, knowing well, that if they do not kill, they ſhall be kill'd themſelves. They pretend to juſtifie themſelves herein, when they ſay, That their Enemy having took the firſt Advantage, they ought to ſecure themſelves of the ſecend: That ſhould they fail herein, they would wrong their Reputation: That you muſt not fight with a Man that has inſulted over you, but put your ſelf in a Condition to puniſh him, without running half the Danger. It is true, that Impunity Authoriſes this Conduct; for the Priviledge
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151523:25"/> of Churches and Convents in</hi> Spain, <hi>is to give an aſſured Retreat to Criminals; And as near as they can, they commit theſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies hard by a Sanctuary, no have the leſs way to an Altar; Which you ſee oft embraced by a Villain, with his Poynard reeking in his Hand, and be-ſmeared with the Blood of the Murther which he has committed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to their Perſons, they are very lean, little, fine ſhape, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Head, good Faces, fine Eyes, well-ſet Teeth, yellow and duskiſh Complexion; they will have one walk ſlowly, commend big Legs, and a little Foot, Shooes without Heels, parting the Hair on both ſides, being ſtrait cut, and kept behind their Ears with a great Two-handed Hat, an Habit always Black, inſtead of a Shirt, Taffity Sleeves, or black Tabby, a Sword of a ſtrange length, with a black Freize Cloak over all this, very ſtrait Breeches, hanging Sleeves, and a Poynard. All this muſt ſo diſ-figure a Man, let him be otherwiſe never ſo well-ſhaped, that they ſeem to affect a Garb the moſt diſagreeable; And ones Eyes cannot with any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency accuſtom themſelves to this fight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Frederick</hi> would have continued on his Diſcourſe, and I had ſo much pleaſure in hearing him, that I would not have interrupted him; but he broke off himſelf, having obſerv'd that the Play was at an end, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that we were to ſet out early next Morning, he thought I might be deſirous of retiring; he therefore with the other Gentlemen, bad me good Night. I roſe in effect very ſoon next Morning, becauſe 'twas a great Journey to <hi>Birbieſca,</hi> where we intended to lie. We follow'd the River to avoid the Mountains, and paſt at <hi>Oron,</hi> a great River, which falls into the <hi>Ehre.</hi> We a while after entred into ſo ſtrait a Way, that our Litters could ſcarce paſs: We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended along, a very ſtrait Coaſt to <hi>Pancorvo,</hi> whoſe Caſtle I ſaw ſtanding on a rais'd Ground, not far diſtant: We tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt a great Plain; and this was a Novelty to us, to ſee an even Country: This here is ſurrounded with ſeveral Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which ſeem linkt together as a Chain, and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Occa:</hi> We muſt again paſs over a little River, before we can come to <hi>Birbieſca:</hi> This is only a Borough, which has nothing remarkable but its Colledge, and ſome few pleaſant Gardens along the Water. But I may ſay, we came thither in worſe Weather than any we had yet: I was ſo tired, that as ſoon as I arriv'd I went to Bed: ſo that I ſaw not <hi>Don Fernand de Toledo,</hi> and the other Gentlemen, till the next Day, at <hi>Caſtel de Peones.</hi> But I ſhould tell you how one is ſerv'd in theſe Inns, they being all alike: When you come into one of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151523:26"/> them, wearied and tired, roaſted by the heat of the Sun, or frozen by the Snows (for there is ſeldom any Temperament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Two Extreams), you ſee neither Pot on the Fire, nor Plates waſh'd: You enter into the Stable, and from thence to your Chamber; this Stable is ordinarily full of Mules and Muletteers, who make uſe of their Mules Saddles for Pillows in the night, and in the day-time they ſerve 'em for Tables: They eat very friendly with their Mules, and are very good Company together.</p>
               <p>The Stair-Caſe by which you go up is very ſtrait, and does rather reſemble a ſorry Ladder: <hi>La Sennoro de la Caſa</hi> receives you with her Gown tuckt up, and her dangling Sleeves; ſhe takes time to put on her <hi>Sunday</hi>-Cloathes, whilſt you get out of your Litter: and ſhe never omits this; for they are all very Poor and Vain Glorious. You are ſhewed a Chamber, whoſe Walls are white enough, hung with a thouſand little ſcurvy Pictures of Saints; the Beds are without Curtains, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures of Cotton, the Sheets as large as Napkins, and the Napkins like Pocket-hankerchiefs; and you muſt be in ſome conſiderable Town to find four or five of them; for in other places there are none, no more than there are Forks: They have only a Cup in the Houſe; and if the Mule-Drivers get firſt hold of it, which commonly happens, if they pleaſe, (for they are ſerv'd with more Reſpect than thoſe whom they bring) you muſt ſtay patiently till they have done with it, or drink out of an Earthen Pitcher. It is impoſſible to warm one at the Kitchin-fire, without being choaked, for they have no Chimneys; and 'tis the ſame in all the Houſes on the Road; there is an Hole made in the top of the Ceiling, and the Smoak goes out thence; the Fire is in the midſt of the Kitchin: They put what you would have roaſted on Tiles, and when 'tis well gril'd on one ſide, they turn the other: when 'tis groſs Meat, they faſten it to a String, and ſo let it hang on the Fire, and turn it with their Hands; ſo that the Smoak makes it ſo black, that it would turn ones Stomach to look on it.</p>
               <p>I think there cannot be a better Repreſentation of Hell than theſe ſort of Kitchins, and the Perſons in them; for not to ſpeak of this horrible Smoak, which blinds and choaks one, they are a Dozen of Men, and as many Women, blacker than Devils, naſty and ſtinking like Swine, and clad like Beggars. There are always ſome of 'em impudently grating on a ſorry Guiter, and ſinging like a Cat a roaſting. The Women have all of 'em their Hair about their Ears, and you would take 'em for <hi>Bedlamites;</hi> they have Glaſs Necklaces, which hang twiſted

               <p>Before all things, the Miſtreſs of the Houſe brings you her little Children, who are bare-headed in the midſt of Winter, though but of a Day old: ſhe makes 'em touch your Cloaths, ſhe rubs their Eyes with them, their Cheeks, Throat, and Hands. This ſeems as if one was become a Relick, and could heal all Diſeaſes. Theſe Ceremonies over, you are askt, If you will eat any thing; and though at Mid-night, you muſt ſend to the Butchery, the Market, the Tavern, the Bakers; in fine, to all parts of the Town, to gather wherewith to make a ſorry Meal. For though the Mutton here be very tender, their way of frying it with Oyl, is not to every Bodies Reliſh. Here are great ſtore of Partridges, and thoſe very large; they are not very fat, but dry; and to make 'em drier, they roaſt 'em to a Coal. The Pidgeons here are excellent; and in ſeve-places here is good Fiſh, eſpecially Beſſugoſſes, which have the taſte of a Trout, and of which they make Paſties, which would be good, were they not ſtuff'd with Garlick, Saffron, and Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Their Bread is white enough, and ſweet, that one would think it made up with Sugar; but it is ill wrought, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle baked, that it is as heavy as Lead in the Stomach: it has the ſhape of a flat Cake, and is not much thicker than one's Finger. The Wine is good, and Fruits in their ſeaſon, eſpecially Grapes, which are very large, and of delicate taſte. You may reckon your ſelf certain of a good Deſart. You have Sallads here of ſuch good Lettice as the World cannot afford better.</p>
               <p>Do not think (Dear Coſin) 'tis ſufficient to ſay, Go fetch ſuch things, to have them; for not very ſeldom you can meet with nothing: But ſuppoſing you find what you would have, you muſt give out your Money before-hand: ſo that your Meat is paid for before you have begun to eat it; for the Maſter of the Inn is only allowed to Lodge you: they alledge for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, That it is not juſt one only Perſon ſhould go away with all the Profit from Travellers, it being better the Money ſhould be diſperſed.</p>
               <p>You enter not any Inn to Dine, but carry your Proviſion with you, and ſtop at the Bank of ſome River, where the Mule-Drivers bate their Mules; and this is with Oats or Barley, with chopt Straw, which they carry with them in great Sacks; for as to Hay they give them 'em none. It is not allow'd a

               <p>After Supper theſe Gentlemen play'd at <hi>Ombre,</hi> and I not being ſtrong enough to play againſt them, I went ſhares with <hi>Don Frederic de Cardonne;</hi> and <hi>Don Fernand</hi> drew near the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to me; he told me, He could, have wiſht my time would permit me to paſs by <hi>Vailladolid;</hi> that it is the moſt pleaſant Town of <hi>Old Castille,</hi> it having been for a great while the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that they have a Palace there fit for them. That as to him, he had Relations there would be infinitely pleaſed to entertain me; and would ſhew me the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Church, which the Dukes of <hi>Lerma</hi> have founded; that it was very Stately, and the Portal of ſingular Beauty, by means of the Figures and Emboſſed Work, which enrich it: That in the Colledge of the ſame Convent the <hi>French</hi> ſee there, with great ſatisfaction, all the Walls full of <hi>Flower de Luces;</hi> it being ſaid, a Biſhop who defended on the King of <hi>France,</hi> had been at the Charge of Painting them. He added, They would have carried me to the Religioſes of St. <hi>Claire,</hi> to ſhew me in the Choire of their Church, the Tomb of a <hi>Caſtillan</hi> Knight, whence 'tis ſaid, iſſues out Accents and Groans every time any of his Family are near their Deaths. I ſmiled at this, as being doubtful of the Truth of ſuch kind of Relations: <q rend="margSglQuotes">You give not Credit to what I ſay, <hi>continued he,</hi> neither would I engage for the Truth of it, though all the Country thereabouts are ſo fully perſwaded of it, that you would be ſuſpected for an Heretick ſhould you queſtion it. But it is certain there is a Bell in <hi>Arragon,</hi> in a ſmall Town call'd <hi>Villilla,</hi> on the <hi>Ebre,</hi> which is about fifty Foot compaſs, and it happens ſometimes to ſound of it ſelf, it being not perceiveable to be agitated by any Wounds or Earthquakes: In a word, by no viſible thing. It firſt Tolls, and afterwards, by intervals, Rings, out, as well in the Day as the Night: When it is heard, it is not doubted but it denounces ſome ſad Accident; which is what hapned in 1601, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 13th of <hi>June,</hi> till <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th of the ſame Month; it ceaſed then to Ring, but it began again on <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> when they were on the point of making the Proceſſion. It was heard likewiſe when <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the Fifth, K. of <hi>Arragon,</hi> went into <hi>Italy</hi> to take Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> It was hard at the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.

               <p>WE could ſenſibly perceive in arriving at <hi>Burgos,</hi> that this Town is colder than any of thoſe we paſt; and 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaid, you have none of thoſe exceſſive Heats which are intollerable in other Parts of <hi>Spain:</hi> The Town ſtands where you deſcend the Mountain, and reaches to the Plain as far as the River, which waſhes the foot of the Wall: the Streets are very ſtrait and even: the Caſtle is not great, but very ſtrong, and is ſeen on the top of the Mountain: A little lower is the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Arch of <hi>Fernando Gonſales,</hi> which the Curious do much admire. This Town was the firſt that was conquer'd from the <hi>Mores;</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have long reſided here; 'tis the Capital of <hi>Old Caſtille;</hi> it holds the firſt Rank in the two States of the two <hi>Caſtilles,</hi> although <hi>Toledo</hi> diſputes it with her: You ſee her fine Buildings; and <hi>Velaſcoe</hi>'s Palace is very ſtately. Here are in all the broad Streets and ſpacious
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151523:28"/> Places, Fountains, with Statues, ſome of which are good Pieces; but the fineſt ſight is the Cathedral, which is ſo large, that Maſs is ſaid in five ſeveral places of it, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to each other: the Architecture is ſo exquiſitely wrought, that it may paſs among the <hi>Gothick</hi> Buildings for a Maſter-Piece of Art: and this is ſo much the more remarkable, in that they build very ſorrily in <hi>Spain:</hi> in ſome places this is ſo through Poverty, and in others want of Stone and Lime: I am told, that even at <hi>Madrid</hi> you ſee Houſes of Earth, and the fineſt are made with Brick, cemented with the ſame, for want of Lime. To paſs from the Town to the Suburbs of <hi>Bega,</hi> you go over three Stone Bridges: the Gate which anſwers that of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> ſtands high, with the Image of the Virgin upon it: this Suburb contains the greateſt part of the Convents and Hoſpitals; there is a great one founded by <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to receive the Pilgrims which go to St. <hi>James,</hi> and which entertains them for a Day. The Abbey of <hi>Miile Flores,</hi> whoſe Building is very ſtately, is not far diſtant. You ſee here in this Suburb ſeveral Gardens which are watered with Fountains and pleaſant Springs; the River ſerves for a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel: And you find in a great Park incloſed with Walls, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Walks at all times of the Year.</p>
               <p>I would have ſeen the Crucifix in the <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Convent; it is placed in a Chappel of the Cloyſter, large and dark enough, ſo that you could hardly diſcern it, were it not for the Lamps, which are continually burning, they'r above an hundred; ſome are of Gold, and others of Silver, of ſo extraordinary a ſize, that they cover all the Vault of this Chappel: there are ſixty Silver Candleſticks of a length, exceeding the talleſt Man, and ſo heavy that two Men cannot lift 'em: they ſtand on the ground on both ſides of the Altar; thoſe which are upon it are of Maſſy Gold: You ſee between 'em two Croſſes of the ſame, ſet out with Precious Stones, and Crowns hanging over the Altar, adorn'd with Pearls and Diamonds of great Luſtre; The Chappel is hung with Tapiſtry, wrought with Gold; it is ſo laden with rich Gifts, that there's hardly room to put 'em in, ſo that part of 'em are kept in the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>The Holy Crucifix ſtands on the Altar, near the natural big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is covered with three Curtains one on another, all embrodered with Pearls and Diamonds: When they open them, which is not done without great Ceremony, and for Perſons of Quality, ſeveral Bells are rung, every one falls on his Knees: and it muſt be granted, that this place and ſight ſtrikes one with an Awful Regard: The Crucifix is of Carv'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151523:29"/> Work, and cannot be better made; its Carnation is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; it is covered from the Breaſts to the Feet with a fine Linnen, in ſeveral Foulds or Pleats, which makes it look like a looſe Jerkin, which in my Opinion, is not over-agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>It is commonly held, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> made it; but thoſe who are for making every thing Miraculous, will have it brought down from Heaven, they know not how nor when. I was told, certain Monks of this Town had once ſtole it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd it away; but it took a convenient time to give 'em the ſlip, and was found the next Morning in the Chappel, in its uſual place: Theſe honeſt People being enraged, that it ſhould ſerve 'em ſuch a Trick, muſtered up their Forces, and violently laid Hands on't the ſecond time, but to as little purpoſe; for 'twould by no means ſtay with 'em: However, it works Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and is one of the chief Objects of Devotion in <hi>Spain:</hi> The Religious tell you, it ſweats every <hi>Friday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was going into my Inn, when we ſaw the <hi>Sieur de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne</hi>'s <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> running as faſt as he could after us; he was booted, and three Friers ſcowring after him: I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-raſh in my Judgment; for I could not but think he had ſtole ſomething in this rich Chappel, and was taken in the Fact; but his Maſter, who was with me, having demanded of him, What put him on ſuch full ſpeed; He anſwer'd, He went into the Chappel of the Holy Crucifix with his Spurs on, and the Fryers had kept him in cuſtody, to get Money of him, but that he was gotten out of their Clutches, but they were now upon the Hunt for him. They make it a Forfeit, as well as others, for a Man to go with Spurs into theſe Holy Places.</p>
               <p>The Town is not very great; it is adorned with a ſpacious Place; here are high Pillars which bear up very fine Lodgings. The Bull-Feaſts are kept here; for the People are much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this ſort of Divertiſement. There is alſo a very well-built Bridge, long and large: the River which paſſes under it bathes a Meadow, on the Bank of which you ſee Allies of Trees, which form a moſt delicious Walk. Trade was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſiderable, but it is of late much diminiſht. The beſt <hi>Caſtillian</hi> is here ſpoken; and the Men are naturally Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo that when the King has need of them, he finds here great Numbers, and better Men than elſewhere.</p>
               <p>After Supper our Company ſet to Play, as heretofore: <hi>Don Sancho Sanniento</hi> was for yielding his place to any one, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twas his Right to entertain me this Evening. I knew he had lately return'd from <hi>Sicily;</hi> I askt him, whether he had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151523:29"/> been one of thoſe who had help'd to Chaſtize thoſe Rebellious People? [Alas, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Las Navas</hi> was ſufficient to puniſh them beyond what their Crime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: I was at <hi>Naples,</hi> in the deſign to paſs into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where I have Relations of the ſame Name. The Marqueſs <hi>de Los Veles,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> engaged me to leave my firſt Project, and embark my ſelf with the Marqueſs <hi>de Las Navas,</hi> whom the King ſent into <hi>Sicily:</hi> We ſet Sail in two Veſſels of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Meſſina</hi> the ſixth of <hi>January.</hi> Having ſent no notice of his coming, and no body expecting it, he was not receiv'd with the Honours paid commonly to the Vice-Roys: But in truth, his Intentions were ſo cruel againſt theſe poor People, that his Entrance ſhould have been made in Tears.</p>
               <p>Scarcely was he arriv'd, but he clapt up the two Sheriffs in Priſon, named <hi>Vicenzo Zuffo,</hi> and <hi>Don Diego:</hi> He put <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Places; he rigorouſly aboliſht the Colledge of Knights of the Star; and began to execute the Orders which <hi>Gonzaga</hi> had long receiv'd, and which he had eluded through Favour or Weakneſs. He immediately publiſht an Order, by which the King chang'd all the Form of Government of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> depriv'd the Town of its Revenues, forbad its bearing for the future the Glorious Title of <hi>Exemplary,</hi> diſſolv'd the Senate, and put into the place of ſix Sheriffs, ſix Officers, two of which ſhould be <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that theſe Officers ſhould not for the future appear in Publick with their Formalities; that they ſhould no more be preceded by Drums and Trumpets, ride no more together in a Coach with four Horſes, as they were wont; that they ſhould fit henceforward on a plain Bench; ſhould have no more Incenſe offered 'em in the Churches; go cloath'd after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion; ſhould Aſſemble on Publick Affairs in a Chamber of the Vice-Roy's Palace; and have no longer any Juriſdiction on the Champian Country.</p>
               <p>Every one was ſeized with ſuch Conſternation, as if he had been Thunder-ſtruck; but their Sorrow was much increaſed on the fifth of the ſame Month, when the Camp Maſter-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral went to the Town-houſe, and ſeized all their Charters, and Original Copies of their Priviledges, and made 'em be burnt publickly by the Hands of the common Hang-man. The Prince <hi>de Condro</hi> was afterwards apprehended, to the great grief of his Family, but particularly the Princeſs <hi>Elenora,</hi> his Siſter, whoſe Tears were not ſhed alone: this Princeſs is not above Eighteen; her Beauty and Wit are miraculous, which aſtoniſh thoſe about her. <hi>Don Sancho</hi>'s Eyes grew red at the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151523:30"/> remembrance of this Princeſs, and I plainly perceiv'd Pity had not all the ſhare in what he ſaid; yet he continued on his Diſcourſe to me of <hi>Meſſina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vice-Roy, <hi>added he,</hi> publiſht an Order, by which all the Citizens were enjoyn'd, under penalty of ten Years Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and five thouſand Crowns Fine, to bring their Arms into his Palace. He at the ſame time caus'd the great Bell in the Town-houſe to be taken down, and beaten to pieces in their ſight: He ordered all the Bells in the Cathedral to be melted, to make a Statue of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And the Prince of <hi>Condro</hi>'s Children were taken into Cuſtody: But their Fear increaſed, when the Vice-Roy ordered <hi>D. V. Zuffo</hi>'s Head to be cut off. This Example of Severity Alarum'd all the People; and what appear'd moſt terrible, was, That in the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſome Families of <hi>Meſſinois</hi> having withdrawn themſelves into ſeveral Parts, the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at <hi>Rome,</hi> adviſed them, as a Friend, to return into their own Country, aſſuring them all was Quier, and that a General Pardon was already publiſht; and for their greater aſſurance, gave them <hi>Paſtports.</hi> Theſe poor People (who had not taken up Arms, and being not of the number of the Revolters, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Innocency, could never have imagin'd they ſhould have been treated as Criminals] return'd to <hi>Meſſina;</hi> where they had ſcarcely landed, but the Joy they had of ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Native Country, and in the midſt, of their Friends, was ſadly diſturb'd, when they were ſeiſed on, and the next Morning, without any Quarter, or regard to Sex or Age, by the Vice-Roy's Order, all hang'd. He afterwards, ſent to demoliſh the great Tower of <hi>Palermo;</hi> and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Citizens of it, remonſtrating againſt the exceſſive Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions on Corn, Silks, and other Commodities, the Marqueſs <hi>de las Navas</hi> ſent them all to the Gallies, without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Tears of their Wives, and the need ſo many poor Children might have of their Fathers.</p>
               <p>I muſt acknowledge, <hi>continued Don Sancho,</hi> that my Nature is ſo averſe to the Rigors every day exercis'd on theſe poor People, that I could not for all the World remain any longer at <hi>Meſſina.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de las Navas</hi> was for ſending to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> to inform the King of what he had done. I intreated him to charge me with this Commiſſion; and in effect he conſented, and gave me his Letters, which I have delivered to the King at <hi>Madrid;</hi> and at the ſame time my Interceſſions for the Prince <hi>de Condro:</hi> And I preſume my good Offices will not be wholly uſeleſs to him. I am perſwaded, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:151523:30"/> this was the principal Motive of your Journey: I am no pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body, but methinks you are greatly concern'd for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of this Family. It's true, Madam, <hi>continued he,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice done this Unfortunate Prince does ſenſibly affect me: Were he not Brother to the Princeſs <hi>Eleonora, ſaid I to him,</hi> perhaps you would not ſo much lay it to heart. But no more of this; I perceive this Remembrance afflicts you. Pray let me rather hear from you what is moſt remarkable in your Country. Ah! Madam, <hi>cried he,</hi> you inſult over me; for you muſt needs know, that <hi>Galicia</hi> is ſo poor and mean a Countrey that there's no place for bragging; not but that the Town of St. <hi>James de Compoſtella</hi> is conſiderable enough: it is the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Province, and ſcarce one in <hi>Spain</hi> that's ſuperiour to it in Riches and Greatneſs: Its Archbiſhoprick is worth Seventy Thouſand Crowns a Year, and the Chapter has as much; It ſtands in an agreeable Plain, ſurrounded with little Hills of moderate heighth; and it ſeems as if Nature had placed them there to defend the Town from thoſe deadly Blaſts which ariſe from other Mountains. Here is a Univerſity, fine Palaces, ſtately Churches, publick Places, and an Hoſpital, one of the moſt conſiderable, and beſt ſerv'd in <hi>Europe:</hi> It conſiſts of two Courts of Extraordinary greatneſs, with Fountains in the midſt. Several Knights of St. <hi>James</hi> live in this Town, and the Metropolis, which is dedicated to this Saint, keeps his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: It is extream ſtately, and prodigiouſly rich: It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you hear a kind of Clattering at his Tomb, as if Arms were ſtruck one againſt another; and this noiſe is only heard when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are to undergo any great Loſs. His Figure is repreſented on the Altar, and the Pilgrims thrice kiſs it, and put their Hats on his Head; for this is the chief part of the Ceremony: they have alſo another very ſingular one; they aſcend the top of the Church, which is covered with great flat Stones; In this place ſtands a Croſs of Iron, whereon the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims ever faſten ſome Rag, or Scrap of what they wear: They paſs under this Croſs by ſo ſtrait a Paſſage, that they are forced to crawl on their Bellies through it; and thoſe who are not ſlender, are in danger of being burſten. And there have been ſome ſo ridiculous and ſuperſtitious, that having omitted to do this, they have expreſly return'd back again three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues; for you ſee here Pilgrims of all Nations. Here is a <hi>French</hi> Chappel, of which great Care is taken; It is ſaid, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have been always great Benefactors to it. The Church which is under ground is a better than that above; there are ſtately Tombs, and Epitaphs of great Antiquity,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151523:31"/> which exerciſe the Wits of Travellers. The Archiepiſcopal Palace is a vaſt Pile, and its Antiquity adds to its Beauty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diminiſhing it. A Man of my Acquaintance, a great Searcher into Etymologies, aſſured me the Town of <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtella</hi> was ſo called, becauſe St. <hi>James</hi> was to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the place where he ſhould ſee a Star appear at <hi>Compeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella.</hi> It is true, <hi>continued he,</hi> that ſome People pretend it to be thus; but the Peoples Credulity and Superſtition car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries 'em further; for you are ſhew'd at <hi>Padron,</hi> near <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> an hollow Stone; and it is pretended this was the little Boat in which St. <hi>James</hi> arriv'd, after he had paſt ſo many Seas in it, which being of Stone, muſt have, without a ſignal Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſunk to the bottom. I ſuppoſe, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> you believe this to be moſt true. <hi>He ſmiled, and continued his Diſcourſe:</hi> I cannot but give you the Deſcription of our <hi>Militia:</hi> They are called together every Year in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> and all the Young Men from the Age of Fifteen, are oblig'd to march; for ſhould it happen that a Father, or any other Relation ſhould conceal his Son or Kinſman, and thoſe who are Officers ſhould come to know it, they would condemn him who has ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to perpetual Impriſonment. There have been ſome Examples of this, but they are rare; for the Peaſants are ſo infinitely pleas'd to ſee themſelves Arm'd, and treated as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valieros &amp; de Nobles Saldados del Rey,</hi> that they would not for any Conſideration be wanting to ſhew themſelves on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. You ſhall ſeldom ſee in an whole Regiment any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that has more Shirts than that on his Back; and the Stuff they wear, ſeems for its Coarſeneſs to be made of Pack-thread: their Shooes are made of Cord; they wear no Stockins, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man has his Peacock, or Dunghil-Cock's Feather in his Cap, which is tied up behind, with a Rag about his Neck in form of a Ruff; their Sword oftentimes hangs by their ſide tied with a bit of Cord, and ordinary without a Scabbard; the reſt of their Arms is ſeldom in better Order: And in this Equipage they march gravely to <hi>Tuy,</hi> where is the General Rendezvouz, it being a Frontier place to <hi>Portugal.</hi> There are three which lie thus, the above-mention'd, <hi>Cindud-Rodrigo,</hi> and <hi>Badajor,</hi> but <hi>Tuy</hi> is the beſt guarded, becauſe it is over-againſt <hi>Valentia,</hi> a conſiderable Town belonging to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and which has been carefully fortifi'd: Theſe two Towns are ſo near, that their Cannon will reach each other; and if the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes</hi> have omitted nothing to put <hi>Valentia</hi> out of danger of being inſulted over, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend <hi>Tuy</hi> is in as good a Condition to defend it ſelf; It ſtands on an Hill, whoſe lower
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151523:31"/> part is waſh'd by the River <hi>Minhio;</hi> it has good Ramparts, ſtrong Walls, and good ſtore of Artillery. It is here, I ſay, where theſe our Champions bid Defiance to the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in a ſtrutting Bravery, declare, they do not fear 'em. Perhaps ſomething of this may happen in time, for here are form'd as good. Troops as in any other part of <hi>Spain.</hi> However, this is a great loſs to the Kingdom, the whole Youth being thus taken up; for the Lands, for the moſt part lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd, and on the ſide of St. <hi>James de Compoſtella,</hi> you wou'd think you ſaw a Wilderneſs; on that of the Ocean, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being better and more peopled, yields greater Profit, and all things neceſſary and convenient, as Oranges, Lemmons and Pomgranates, ſeveral ſorts of Fruits, and excellent Fiſh, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Pilchards, more delicate than thoſe which come from <hi>Royan</hi> to <hi>Bordeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the moſt remarkable things, in my mind, in this Kingdom, is the Town of <hi>Doienſe,</hi> one part of which always enjoys the Sweetneſs of the Spring, and the Fruits of Autumn, by reaſon of ſeveral Springs of boiling Water, which warm the Air by their Exhalations; whil'ſt the other part of this ſame Town ſuffers the Rigors of the longeſt Winters, ſtanding as it does at the Foot of a very cold Mountain; ſo that you find in the ſpace of one only Seaſon, all thoſe which compoſe the courſe of the Year.</p>
               <p>You ſay nothing, <hi>replied I to him,</hi> of the marvellous Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, call'd <hi>Louzano.</hi> Who have told you of it, Madam? <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd he.</hi> Perſons that have ſeen it, <hi>added I.</hi> You have been then told, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> that on the top of the Mountain of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret,</hi> you find this Fountain at the Source of the River <hi>Lours;</hi> which has Flux and Reflux as the Sea, tho' it be at twenty Leagues diſtance from it; that the greater the Heats are, the more Water it caſts, that this Water is ſometimes cold as Ice, and ſometimes as hot as if it boil'd, there being no Natural Cauſe to be giv'n for it. You learn me Particulars I was ignorant of, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> and this is doing me a great Pleaſure, for I want not for Curioſity in relation to things uncommon. I wiſh, <hi>replied he,</hi> 'twas not ſo late, I would give you an account of ſeveral Rarities in <hi>Spain,</hi> and which perhaps you would gladly learn. I leave you for to Night, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> but I hope before we come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> we ſhall have an opportunity of diſcourſing of them. He very civilly made me a Promiſe; and the Play being ended, we bad one another good night.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:151523:32"/>
               <p>When I would go to reſt, I was led into a Gallery full of Beds, as you ſee in Hoſpitals: I ſaid, this was ridiculous; and that needing only four, what occaſion was there for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me forty, and to put me into ſuch an open place to ſtarve me? I was anſwer'd, This was the beſt place in the Houſe, and I muſt take up with it. I caus'd my Bed to be made, when ſcarce was I laid down, but ſome body knockt ſoftly at my Door; my Women opened it, and remained much ſurpriz'd to ſee the Maſter and Miſtreſs followed by a dozen of ſorry creatures, and ſo cloath'd that they were half naked. I drew my Curtain at the Noiſe they made, and opened more mine Eyes at the ſight of this Noble Company. The Miſtreſs drew near to me, and told me, Theſe were honeſt Travellers, who were coming into the Beds which remained empty. <hi>How, lie here?</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I believe you have loſt your Senſes. I ſhould have loſt 'em indeed,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>ſhould I let ſo many Beds ſtand Empty. Either, Madam, you muſt pay for them, or theſe honeſt Gentlemen muſt lye in them.</hi> I cannot expreſs my Rage to you; I was in the mind to ſend for <hi>Don Fernand</hi> and my Knights, who would have ſooner made 'em paſs through the Windows than through the Doors: But I conſidered this could not be done without ſome Diſturbance, and therefore I came to Terms, and agreed to pay 20 <hi>d.</hi> for each Bed: they are hardly dearer at <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> when the Court is there. Theſe Illuſtrious <hi>Dons,</hi> or, to ſpeak better, <hi>Tatterdemalions,</hi> who had the Inſolence to come into my Room, immediately withdrew, having made me ſeveral profound Reverences.</p>
               <p>The next Morning I thought to have burſt with laughter, tho 'twas at my Coſt, when I diſcovered mine Hoſteſs's Trick to ruin me: For you muſt know in the firſt place, that theſe pretended Travellers were their Neighbours, and that they are accuſtomed to this Stratagem, when they ſee Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: But when I would have reckoned the Beds to pay for em, they were rowled all of 'em into the midſt of the Gallery; there were divers wretched Troughs of Straw pull'd out, which were hardly good enough to entertain Dogs, yet I muſt pay for each 20 <hi>d.</hi> Four Piſtoles ended our Diſpute. I was not able to put my ſelf in a Paſſion, ſuch ſingularity did I find in this Management. I would not recount this little Accident to you, did it not ſerve to give you ſome inſight into the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of this Nation.</p>
               <p>We ſet out from <hi>Burgos</hi> very late, the Weather was ſo bad, and there had fall'n in the Night ſuch great quantity of Rain, that I tarry'd there as long as I could, in expectation of its
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151523:32"/> ceaſing. In fine, I came to a Reſolution, and aſcended my Litter. I had not gotten far from the Town, but I repented of my leaving it; no Track cou'd be ſeen, eſpecially on a very high ſteep Mountain, over which we muſt neceſſarily paſs. One of our Mule-drivers, who went before, ſtruck too far on the Edge of this Mountain, ſo that he fell with his Mule into a kind of Precipice, where he broke his Head, and put his Arm out of joynt; this being the famous <hi>Philip de St. Sebaſtian,</hi> the moſt intelligent of all his Profeſſion, and who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carries Perſons of Quality to <hi>Madrid;</hi> he was therefore much bemoaned; and we remain'd a great while before we could hale him out from the ſcurvy place where he had fall'n; <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was ſo compaſſionate as to let him have his Litter. The Night came ſpeedily on us, and we could have comforted our ſelves, could we have return'd to <hi>Burgos,</hi> but it was impoſſible, the ways were no leſs covered with Snow on that ſide, than all the reſt; ſo that we put in at <hi>Madrigaleſco,</hi> which has not above a doſen Houſes, and I may ſay we were beſieg'd without having any Enemies. This Adventure gave us ſome diſturbance, tho' we had brought Proviſions with us for ſeveral Days. The beſt Houſe of the Town has half unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and I was ſcarce lodged there, when a venerable Old Man askt for me on the part of a Lady who was juſt arrriv'd: He made me a Compliment, and told me, He was inform'd this was the only place where there was any tolerable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; and therefore intreated me to ſpare her ſome room. He added, She was a Perſon of Quality of <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> was lately a Widow, and that he had the Honour to belong to her.</p>
               <p>One of our Knights, named <hi>Don Eſteve de Carjaval,</hi> who is of the ſame Country, fail'd not to demand her Name of the old Gentleman: He told him, ſhe was the Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Rios.</hi> At this Name he turn'd towards me, and ſpake to me of her as of a Perſon whoſe Merit and Fortune were very conſiderable; I readily accepted of this good Company: She immediately came in her Litter, out of which ſhe had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, having found no Houſe where ſhe could abide.</p>
               <p>Her Dreſs ſeem'd to me very ſingular; had ſhe not been ſo handſome as ſhe was, ſhe could never have appear'd in any ſort tolerable: Her Gown and Petticoat was of black Serge, and over them a kind of Linnen Surplice, which reacht down lower than her Knees; the Sleeves were long, and ſtrait in the Arms, which hung over her Hands: This Surplice was faſtned to her Gown, and being not pleated behind, it ſeem'd like a Bib: ſhe wore on her Head a piece of Muſlin, which covered
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151523:33"/> her Face, and one would have taken it for a Religioſe's Hood; this covered her Neck, and reach'd down very low: There appear'd no Hair on her Head, they were all hid under this Muſlin: She wore a great Mantle of black Taffaty, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her Heels; and over this Mantle ſhe had an Hat, whoſe Brims were very large, faſtned under her Chin with ſilken Twiſt. I was told they wear this but only when they travel.</p>
               <p>This is the Habit of the Widows and <hi>Duenna's,</hi> a Dreſs which is inſupportable to my ſight; and ſhould one meet with a Woman in the Night thus cloath'd, one might be ſtartled without Reproach; yet the Lady was very beautiful in this Unſeemly Dreſs. They never leave it, unleſs they marry; and they are oblig'd to bewail the Death of an Husband, whom they could not endure when living.</p>
               <p>I was inform'd they paſs the firſt Year of their Mourning in a Chamber hung with Black, wherein there is not the leaſt glimmering of Day-light to be ſeen; they fit croſs-legg'd on a little <hi>Holland</hi>-Quilt. When this Year is ended, they retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chamber hung with Gray: they muſt have no Pictures, nor Looking-Glaſſes, nor Cabinets, nor fine Tables, nor Plate, neither muſt they have any Diamonds, or wear any Colours: However modeſt they are, they muſt live ſo retired, that it muſt ſeem their Soul is already in the other World. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint is the cauſe that ſeveral Ladies who are wealthy, and eſpecially in rich Houſhold-Goods, marry again to have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of making uſe of them.</p>
               <p>After the firſt Compliments, I inform'd my ſelf from this mournful Widow where ſhe was going; ſhe told me, She had not for a long time ſeen a Friend of her Mother's who was a Religious at <hi>Laſhuelgas de Burgos,</hi> which is a famous Nunnery, wherein there is an hundred and fifty Nuns, moſt of 'em the Daughters of Princes, Dukes and Titulado's. She added, That the Abbeſs is Lady of fourteen large Towns, and above fifty other Places, wherein ſhe chuſes Governors and Magiſtrates; that ſhe is Superior of ſeventeen Convents; Collates to ſeveral Benefices, and diſpoſes of twelve Commanderſhips in favour of whom ſhe pleaſes. She told me ſhe deſign'd to paſs ſome time in this Monaſtery: <hi>Can you, Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>accuſtom your ſelf to ſo retired a Life as is that of a Convent? It will be no hard matter,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>for I believe I ſee fewer People at my own Houſe than I ſhall ſee there; and in effect theſe Religious have Liberty enough: They are commonly the handſomeſt young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Family who are there; theſe enter therein ſo young, that they know not what they are made to leave, nor what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151523:33"/> at the Age of ſix or ſeven, and it may be ſooner. They are cauſed to make Vows, when 'tis often the Father or Mother, or ſome near Relation, who pronounce them for 'em, whilſt the little Sacrifice diſports her ſelf with Sugar-plums, and lets 'em dreſs her how they will: Yet the Bargain holds, there's no unſaying it; however, they have every thing which can be expected in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. There are at</hi> Madrid <hi>ſ me whom they call the Ladies of St.</hi> James: <hi>they are properly Canonneſſes, who make their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als like the Knights of this Order; they bear, like them, a Sword made in form of a Croſs, embroidered with Crimſon Silk; they have 'em on their Scapularies and great Cloaks, which are white: Theſe Ladies Houſe is very ſtately; all who come to viſit 'em enter without any difficulty; their Apartments are very fine, and every whit as well furniſh'd as if they were at large in the World; they enjoy great Penſions, and each of 'em has three or four Women to wait on them: It's true, they never ſtir out, nor ſee their nearest Relations, but through ſeveral Grates. This perhaps would look horrid in another Country, but in</hi> Spain <hi>they are accuſtom'd to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are Convents where the Religious ſee more Cavaliers than the Women who live at large, neither are they leſs gallant; It is impoſſible for any to have more Gayety than they; and, as I have already told you, Madam, here are more Beauties than abroad; but it muſt be granted, there are ſeveral among them who are deeply ſenſible at their having been ſo ſoon ſacrific'd; they think of the Pleaſures which they have never tasted, as the only ones which can make this Life Happy. They paſs theirs in a Condition wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Compaſſion, always telling you, they are there by Force; and that the Vows they are made to repeat at the Age of five or ſix Years, are to be regarded like Childrens Plays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>it wou'd have been great pity, had your Relations deſign'd you for ſuch a Life; and one may judge, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding you, that all the beautiful</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ladies are not Religioſes. Alas, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, in fetching a deep Sigh, <hi>I know not what I wou'd be; it ſeems I am of a very odd Humor, not to be contented with my Fortune: but one has ſometimes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſineſſes which are unaccountable to Reaſon.</hi> In ending theſe words, ſhe faſtned her Eyes to the ground, and fell into ſuch a deep fit of Muſing, that I cou'd eaſily perceive ſomething diſturb'd her.</p>
               <p>Whatever Curioſity I had to know the Subject, we had been ſo little together, that I dared not deſire to be her Confident; but to draw her from the melancholy Poſture ſhe was in, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to tell me ſome News of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151523:34"/> ſhe came from <hi>Madrid.</hi> She did what ſhe cou'd to recover her ſelf: ſhe then told me, There were great ſhews of Joy at Court on the Queen's Birth-day: that the King had ſent one of the Gentlemen of his Chamber to <hi>Toledo,</hi> to Compliment her from him: Yet theſe fine Appearances hindred not the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera,</hi> the Queen's <hi>Major Domo,</hi> from receiving Orders to retire twenty Leagues from the Court, which had greatly mortifi'd this Princeſs. She inform'd us, That the Fleet which carried Troops to <hi>Galicia,</hi> was unhappily caſt away on the Coaſts of <hi>Portugal.</hi> That the little Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> was to Eſpouſe <hi>Don Nicolo Pignatelli,</hi> Prince <hi>de Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> her Uncle. That the Marqueſs <hi>de Laganez</hi> had refuſed the Vice-royalty of <hi>Sardagnia,</hi> being in love with a fine Lady, whom he cou'd not find in his heart to leave. That <hi>Don Carlos de Omodei,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>d' Almanazid,</hi> was dangerouſly ill, at his Diſappointment of being admitted a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which he pretended, having marry'd the Heireſs of the Houſe and Grandeurſhip of <hi>Caſtle Rodrigue;</hi> and that which moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly afflicted him, was, that <hi>Don Ariel de Guſman,</hi> this Lady's firſt Husband, had enjoyed this Honour; ſo that he cou'd not but look on the Difficulties thrown in his way as a ſlighting of his Perſon: <hi>In truth, Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>I can hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how a Man of ſence, can with ſuch eagerneſs purſue, and be ſo greatly dejected at a Diſappointment of this Nature. We are otherwiſe affected in</hi> Spain, replied the beautiful Widow, <hi>and this Inſtance is a proof of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Frederic de Cardonne,</hi> who greatly intereſted himſelf for the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> askt her News of him: <hi>The King,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>has lately made him Preſident of the</hi> Indies. <hi>The Queen-Mother has wrote to the King, on the Report which runs, that he is about Marrying; that ſhe is ſurpriz'd things are already gone ſo far, and he has not acquainted her with them. She adds in her Letter, She adviſed him in the mean time, whilſt all things were ready for this Ceremony, to make a Journey to</hi> Catalonia <hi>and</hi> Arragon. Don John <hi>of</hi> Auſtria <hi>ſufficiently underſtands the Neceſſity of this, and he preſſes the King to depart, to content theſe People, in promiſing by Oath, according as is customary to new Kings, to maintain all their ancient Priviledges. Have then, Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, interrupting her, <hi>the</hi> Arrogonois <hi>any other Priviledges than the</hi> Caſtillians? <hi>Very particular ones,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, <hi>and you being a Stranger, I believe you will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let me inform you of them.</hi> Here's what I learnt:</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:151523:34"/>
               <p>The Daughter of Count <hi>Julien,</hi> named <hi>Cava,</hi> was one of the moſt beautiful Ladies in the World: King <hi>Rodrigue</hi> became ſo paſſionately in love with her, that his Affections knowing no Bounds, tranſported him beyond all meaſure. The Father, who was then in <hi>Affrica,</hi> inform'd of the Outrage done his Daughter, who breath'd nothing but Revenge, treated with the <hi>Moors,</hi> and ſupplied 'em with the means to enter into <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>714,</hi> after the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> wherein <hi>D. Rodrigue</hi> loſt his Life; others ſay, he fled into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and died in a Town there call'd <hi>Viſcii.</hi>
                  </note> and to make there, for ſundry Ages, all thoſe Ravages ſet forth at large in hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arragonois</hi> were the firſt who ſhook off the Yoak of theſe Barbarians; and finding no more among them any Princes of the Race of the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings, they agreed to Elect one, and caſt their eyes on a Lord of the Country, call'd <hi>Garci Ximinex;</hi> but they being Maſters, to impoſe Laws on him, and finding himſelf ſufficiently Happy that he might Rule over them under any Condition, theſe People therefore confin'd him within narrow Bounds.</p>
               <p>They agreed, That as ſoon as their Monarch ſhou'd break through any of their Laws, he ſhou'd immediately forfeit his Power, and they be at full liberty to chuſe another, though he were a Pagan: and to hinder him from violating their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and to defend themſelves againſt him, they eſtabliſht a Soveraign Magiſtrate, whom they call'd the <hi>Juſticia,</hi> whoſe Office was to obſerve the Conduct of the King, the Judges, and he People: but the Power of a Soveraign being likely to Awe a meer Particular, to Aſſure the <hi>Juſticia</hi> in the Execution of his Office, they ordered, That he might not ſuffer either in his Perſon or Goods, but by a compleat Aſſembly of the States, which they call <hi>Las Cortes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They moreover provided, That if the King ſhou'd Oppreſs any one of his Subjects, the great and conſiderable Men of the Kingdom might aſſemble themſelves, and hinder his receiving any of his Revenues, till the Innocent was acquitted, and re-eſtabliſht in his former Rights. And to make <hi>Garci Ximinez</hi> timely ſenſible of the Power this Man had over him, they ſet him on a kind of a Throne, and made the King to kneel down bare headed before him, to receive from him his Oath of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Priviledges. This Ceremony ended, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him their Sovereign, but in as odd as diſreſpectful a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151523:35"/> Manner, for inſtead of promiſing him Fidelity and Obedience, they ſay to him, <hi>We who are as good Men as your ſelf we make you our King and Governour, on Condition you keep to us our Rights and Properties, otherwiſe we Diſacknowledge you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> in proceſs of time coming to the Crown, reliſht this Cuſtom, as unworthy of the Regal State; and it ſo greatly diſguſted him, that by his Authority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and the Offers he made of beſtowing ſeveral notable Priviledges on the Kingdom, he procured the Aboliſhment of this, in an Aſſembly of the States: he got this general Conſent in Writing, which was preſented to him. As ſoon as he had the Parchment, he drew out his Dagger, and pierced his Hand with it, ſaying, <hi>'Twas fit a Law which gave Subjects the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of chuſing their Sovereign ſhould be Effaced with their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's Blood.</hi> His Statue is ſtill ſeen in the Deputation-Hall of <hi>Saragoſſa:</hi> he holds a Dagger in one Hand, and the Charter in the other. The late Kings have not been ſuch Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of their Priviledges as the firſt.</p>
               <p>But there is a Law ſtill in force, and which is very ſingular, and this they call, <hi>The Law of Manifeſtation;</hi> which is, That if an <hi>Arragonois</hi> had Wrong done him in Judgment, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning 500 Crowns, he may bring his Cauſe before the <hi>Juſticia,</hi> who is obliged, after an exact Perquiſition, to puniſh him who has giv'n a wrong Sentence: And if he fails therein, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt Perſon may have Recourſe to the States of the Kingdom, who Aſſemble and Nominate five Perſons of their Body, which is to ſay, of the Prime Nobility, the Eccleſiaſticks, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Commonalty: they appoint three out of the firſt Rank, and two from each of the others. But it is obſervable, they chooſe the moſt Ignorant to Judge the moſt able Men in the Gown, whether to Diſgrace 'em the more for their Fault, or, as they alledge, <hi>That Juſtice ſhould be ſo clear, that the very Plow-men, and thoſe who underſtand the leaſt, ſhould diſcern it without the help of Oratory.</hi> It is likewiſe affirm'd, That the Judges tremble when they pronounce a Sentence, fearing leſt it turn againſt themſelves, to the loſs of their Lives or Eſtates, ſhould they commit the leaſt Fault therein, either wilfully, or through Inadvertency. It were well if this Cuſtom were obſerved in all Kingdoms: but this is rather to be wiſh'd than expected.</p>
               <p>Yet what is no leſs ſingular, is That Juſtice remains always Soveraign; and though the Unjuſt Judge be puniſh'd ſeverely for his wrong Decree, yet it ſubſiſts in its full force, and is fully executed: If then any Unhappy Wretch be ſentenced to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151523:35"/> Death, he is not ſpared, tho' his Innocency be diſcovered, and made as clear as Noon-day; but his Judges are executed too before his Face; which, in my mind, is a poor Conſolation. If the Judge accuſed, as juſtly perform'd his Office, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff leaves the 500 Crowns which he had confign'd: But were he to loſe an 100000 Crowns of Annual Revenue, by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he complains of, the Sentence or Decree remains good, and the Judge is only condemn'd to pay him likewiſe 500 Crowns; the reſt of this Judge's Eſtate is forfeited to the King: which is, in my Opinion, another Point of Injuſtice; for in fine, he ought, above all others, to have Recompence made him who ſuffers by a wrong Sentence.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſame People have another Cuſtom, to diſtinguiſh by the Puniſhment the Crime committed: for Example, A Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, who has kill'd another in Duel (for they are here ſtrictly forbid), he has his Head cut off before; and he that has Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, his is cut off behind. This is to diſtinguiſh him who has behaved himſelf like a brave Man, from him that kills you Treacherouſly.</p>
               <p>She added, That to ſpeak in general of the <hi>Arragonois,</hi> They have a Natural Pride, which is hard to be ſuppreſs'd: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to do them Juſtice, there are People of brave Minds to be found among them; inſomuch, that they are eaſily diſcern'd from all the reſt of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Subjects: That they have never wanted Great Men, from their firſt King to <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand:</hi> That they counted ſuch a great number of them, as would ſcarce be believ'd: However, they have greatly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended themſelves by their Valour and Conduct. That as to the reſt, their Country was ſo little fruitful, that excepting ſome Valleys which were watered by Channels, whoſe Water came from the <hi>Ebre,</hi> the reſt was ſo dry and ſandy, that you meet with ſcarce any thing elſe but ſtony and parched up pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: That <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> is a great City, the Houſes finer than at <hi>Madrid;</hi> the Publick Places adorn'd with Arches; That the Holy Street, where the Courſes are run, is ſo long and large, as may make it paſs for a great and vaſt place, having ſeveral great Mens Palaces on it; that of <hi>Caſtelmorato</hi> being one of the pleaſanteſt: That the Vault of St. <hi>Fancis</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> was very curious, for being of extraordinary Largeneſs, yet 'tis upheld by no Pillars: That the City is not ſtrong, but the Inhabitants ſo ſtout, that it needed no Walls; that it has never a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, this being one of its greateſt Defects: That the <hi>Ebre</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no Boats, the River being full of dangerous Rocks. As to the reſt, the Archbiſhoprick was worth 60000 Crowns a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151523:36"/> Year: That the Vice-Royalty brought in no Revenue, being a Place of Honour, fit only for great Lords to bear the Expence of it, to maintain their Ranks, and keep the People under, who are Naturally Fierce and Imperious, not Affable to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and ſo little deſirous of making Acquaintance, that they chuſe rather to ſtay at Home alone all their Life-time, than ſtir out to procure Friendſhips: That here is a ſevere Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have a ſtately Palace, and a moſt Rigid Court of Juſtice; Yet this does not hinder great Troops of Robbers, call'd <hi>Bandoleros,</hi> from Ravaging, and diſperſing themſelves over all <hi>Spain;</hi> who give no Quarter to Travellers, ſnatching up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Women of Quality, whom they afterwards ſet at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, for their Parents to Redeem; but when they are Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome they keep them: And this is the greateſt Misfortune can happen to 'em, being forc'd to ſpend their Days with the Worſt of Men, who keep them in dreadful Caves, or carry them along with them on Horſe-back, being ſo furiouſly jealous of 'em, that one of their Captains (having been lately ſet upon by Souldiers ſent into the Mountains to ſeize on him) being mortally wounded, and having his Miſtreſs with him, who was of the Marqueſs <hi>de Camaraza,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Family: When ſhe ſaw him in this Condition, ſhe thought only of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſe of this favourable Opportunity of ſaving her ſelf; which he perceiving, dying, as he was, he catch'd hold of her Hair, and ſtruck his Dagger into her Breaſt, being not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that another ſhould poſſeſs a Treaſure which had been ſo dear to him. And this is what himſelf acknowledg'd to the Souldiers who found him, and ſaw this ſad Spectacle.</p>
               <p>The Beautiful Marchioneſs here held her peace; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd her all due Thanks for the Favour ſhe did me, in inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me of theſe Curioſities; and of which, perhaps without her, I might have been Ignorant all my Life. <hi>I do not think, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>you owe me ſuch Thanks; I rather fear the having deſerved Reproaches for ſo long and tireſome a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not let her leave me to eat elſewhere; and I obliged her to lye with me, ſhe having no Bed. So Civil and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous a Proceeding made her much my Friend. She aſſured me of this in ſuch Affectionate Terms, that I could not doubt of it; for I muſt tell you, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women are more Careſſing than we, and are far more Kind and Tender to thoſe they profeſs Friendſhip, In fine, I could not forbear telling her, <hi>That if ſhe had all the Kindneſs for me ſhe made profeſſion, ſhe must be ſo complaiſant, to inform me, What made her ſeem ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:151523:36"/> melancholly? That I had heard her fetch deep Sighs in the Night, and appear'd very Reſtleſs and Diſconſolate; That if ſhe could find any Comfort in ſharing her Grief with me, I offered my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to her, as a moſt faithful Friend.</hi> She embraced me with great Affection, and told me, without delay, ſhe would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſatisfie my Curioſity; which ſhe did in theſe Terms:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seeing you are deſirous to know me, I muſt without diſguiſing to you any thing, acknowledge my Weakneſſes to you: and by my Sincerity and Open-heartedneſs, deſerve a Curioſity as obliging as yours:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come not of ſuch a Family as may claim Nobility; my Father's Name was <hi>Davila;</hi> he was only a Banker, but he was in good Credit, and was moderately Wealthy: We are of <hi>Seville,</hi> Capital of <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> and we have ever dwelt there. My Mother knew the World, ſhe ſaw many People of Quality, and having no Children but me, ſhe took great care of my Education: It did not appear ill-beſtowed on me; for I had the good Fortune to get the good Will of moſt that ſaw me.</p>
               <p>We had two Neighbours who came often to our Houſe, who were very welcome both to my Father and Mother: Their Condition and Age were in no ſort alike; One was the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios,</hi> a Perſon Wealthy and Noble; he was a Widower, and well advanced in years: the other was the Son of a great Merchant, who traded to the <hi>Indies;</hi> he was Young and Handſome, he had Wit, and a very graceful Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; his Name was <hi>Mendez;</hi> He was not long before he fell paſſionately in Love with me; ſo that he omitted nothing which might pleaſe me, and gain my Affections.</p>
               <p>He was in all places where he knew I was to paſs; he ſpent whole Nights under my Windows, to ſing Verſes which he had compoſed and ſet to my Praiſe, which he had very well accompany'd with his Harp.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing his Attendancies had not all the Effect he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and having paſt ſome time in this manner, without daring to mention his Affection to me, he at length reſolv'd to make uſe of the firſt occaſion to acquaint me with it. I avoid-: ed him ever ſince I had a Converſation with one of my Friends, who had more Experience and Knowledge of the World than I: I had felt, that <hi>Mendez's</hi> Company gave me Joy, and that my Heart had an Emotion for him, which it had not for others: That when his Affairs, or our Viſits hindred him from ſeeing me, I grew reſtleſs; and loving this young Woman, above
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151523:37"/> others, and being as dear to her, ſhe obſerv'd I was not ſo free and gay as I was wont, and that my Eyes were ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively fixed on <hi>Mendez.</hi> One Day when ſhe rally'd with me about it, I ſaid to her very innocently, <hi>My dear</hi> Henrieta, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine to me the Sentiments I have for</hi> Mendez: <hi>I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ought to be afraid of them, and whether I ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf from them. I feel I know not what ſort of Trouble and Pleaſure ariſing in my Breaſt.</hi> She began to laugh, ſhe embraced me, and ſaid to me, <hi>My dear Heart, you are in Love. Who, I in Love?</hi> reply'd I, in amaze: <hi>You joke with me; I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am, nor will be in Love. This depends not always on us,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, with a more ſerious Air, <hi>our Stars decide this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Hearts. But in earneſt, what is it ſo much ſtartles you?</hi> Mendez <hi>is in a Condition equal to yours; he deſerves well, a good comely Man; and if his Affairs go on with the ſame ſucceſs as they have done hitherto, you may live very happily with him. And whence ſhould I learn,</hi> reply'd I, interrupting her, <hi>that he will be happy with me, and that he ſo much as thinks this? O, take my Word for it,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>whatever he has done has its Deſigns; for Men are not wont to paſs Nights under Windows, and the Days in following a Perſon for whom they have nothing but Indifferency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſome other Diſcourſe of this Nature, ſhe left me, and I reſolv'd, maugre the Repugnance I felt in me, to give <hi>Mendez</hi> no opportunity of ſpeaking to me in particular.</p>
               <p>But one Night as I was walking in the Garden, he came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me: I was perplext to ſee my ſelf alone with him; and he had the opportunity of obſerving it on my Countenance, and in the manner after which I receiv'd him. This could not divert him from the deſign he had of entertaining me: <hi>How Happy am I, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to find you alone? But do I call my ſelf Happy! Perhaps I know not what I ſay: for it may be you will not receive a Secret with which I would entruſt you. I am as yet ſo young,</hi> ſaid I to him, bluſhing, <hi>that I would adviſe you to ſay nothing to me, unleſs you would have me impart it to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Alas,</hi> continued he, <hi>ſhould I tell you, I adore you; that all my Happineſs depends on the Inclinations you have towards me: That I cannot live without ſome Certainty, that I may one day pleaſe you; will you tell this to your Companions? No,</hi> ſaid, I to him, in great perplexity, <hi>I would look on this Confidence as a Railery, and not believing it my ſelf, I would not hazard its being left to be believ'd by others.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:151523:37"/>
               <p>We were interrupted as I ended theſe words; and he appear'd to me not over-content with the Anſwer I made him; and a while after he found an opportunity to reproach me with it.</p>
               <p>I could not but give a favourable Ear to the Inclinations I had towards him; every thing he told me ſeem'd to me to have its particular Gracefulneſs: And it was no hard matter for him to perſwade me, that he lov'd me above all things in the World. In the mean time, the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios</hi> took ſuch a liking to me, and my Perſon and Behaviour ran ſo deeply in his Thoughts, that he wholly applied himſelf to pleaſe me. He was very nice and cautious; he could not reſolve with himſelf to owe me wholly to my Parents Authority: He well knew they would receive as an Honour the Intentions he had for me; but he was for gaining my Conſent before he demanded theirs.</p>
               <p>In this Deſign he ſaid all to me he thought was like to take with me. I anſwer'd him, I ſhould always think it an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Duty to obey my Father: yet our Ages were ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that I told him, I thought 'twere better he left off think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me; that I ſhould have an everlaſting Acknowledgment for the advantageous Intentions he had for me: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would eſteem him, tho I could not love him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard what I ſaid, he was ſome time without ſpeaking, and immediately taking up a very generous Reſolution: <hi>Lovely</hi> Mariana, ſays he, <hi>you might have made me the happieſt Man in the World; and if you were ambitious, I had therewith to ſatisfie you: But you refuſe me, and I deſire to be anothers: I conſent to it; I love you too well to be in ſuſpence, whether you are to be ſatisfied or I; I therefore wholly ſacrifice my Happineſs to you, and leave you for ever.</hi> In ending theſe Words he left me, and appear'd ſo afflicted, that I could not forbear being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mendez</hi> arriv'd a while after, and found me melancholly: He was ſo earneſt with me to know the Cauſe, that I could not deny him this Proof of my Complaiſance. Any one but he would have had a ſenſible Obligation at the Excluſion I came from giving his Rival: But far from ſeeming to value it, he told me, He ſaw in mine Eyes the Regret I had for a Lover, who could place me in another ſort of a Rank than he was able; and that my Proceeding was very Cruel. In vain I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make him ſenſible of the Injuſtice of his; but all I could ſay, could not hinder him from charging me with Inconſtancy. I remain'd vext, and ſurpriz'd at this his way of Dealing, and was ſeveral days without ſpeaking to him.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:151523:38"/>
               <p>He, in fine, at laſt underſtood he had no Reaſon to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; he came to me, begg'd my Pardon, and teſtified to me a great Diſpleaſure at his own Jealouſie: He excuſed himſelf, as all Lovers do, on the ſtrength of his Paſſion. I had ſo much Weakneſs as to be willing to forget the Trouble he had given me: we made up the Matter between us, and he continued on his Courtſhip.</p>
               <p>His Father having underſtood the Paſſion he had for me, thought he could not procure him a more advantageous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: he took notice of it to him, and came afterwards to my Father, to open to him the Propoſal: they had been long Friends; he was favourably heard, and they eaſily agreed on the Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mendez</hi> came to inform me of the News, with ſuch Tranſports as would have ſeem'd ridiculous to any other than a Miſtreſs. My Mother order'd me to look kindly on him, telling me, this Affair would be advantageous to me: and as ſoon as the <hi>India</hi>-Fleet ſhould arrive, wherein he was greatly concern'd, the Marriage ſhould be concluded.</p>
               <p>Whilſt matters thus paſt, the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to one of his Country-Houſes, where he ſcarcely ſaw any one: He led a languiſhing Life; he ſtill lov'd me, but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf from telling me ſo, and from comforting himſelf by this innocent Remedy.</p>
               <p>In fine, his Body could not reſiſt the Heavineſs of his Mind; he fell dangerouſly ill, and being told by the Phyſicians, there was no hope of his Recovery, he pluckt up his Spirits to write me the moſt affectionate Letter imaginable, and ſent at the ſame time to me a Deed of Gift of all his Eſtate, in caſe he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My Mother was in my Chamber, when a Gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this Packet from him; ſhe would know what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
               <p>I could not forbear at the ſame time, telling her what had paſt; and we were both of us in the greateſt ſurprize at the Marqueſs's extream Generoſity. She ſent him word, that I ſhould go with my Family to thank him for a Liberality which I had no ways deſerv'd: And in particular, ſhe ſharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended me for having made a Myſtery of a thing to her with which I ought to have immediately acquainted her. I threw my ſelf at her Feet, I excuſed my ſelf the beſt I could, and teſtifi'd ſuch great Sorrow for having diſpleas'd her, that ſhe eaſily pardon'd me. Leaving my Chamber, ſhe went to my Father, and having learnt him all which had paſt, they reſolv'd to go the next morning to ſee the Marqueſs, and to carry me with them.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:151523:38"/>
               <p>I acquainted <hi>Mendez</hi> with this in the Evening; and the Fear I had, leſt my Parents ſhould, in fine, make me marry this old Man, if he chanced to eſcape out of his Sickneſs. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſenſible I appear'd to him of this, he was ſo far tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and reproacht me ſo greatly with it, that I muſt have lov'd him as much as I did, not to have broke off with him: But he had ſuch an Aſcendant over me, though he was the Injuſteſt of all Men, yet I thought him the moſt Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>We were at the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios</hi>'s; his Country-houſe was not above two Leagues from <hi>Seville:</hi> Dying, as he was, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd us with ſuch Joy as was eaſily obſervable. My Father teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd to him his Grief, to ſee him in ſo low a Condition, thankt him for the Donation he made me, and aſſured him, If he could find a fair and juſt Pretence, he would break ofs with <hi>Mendez,</hi> to whom he had engaged his Word: That ſhould this happen, he promiſt him ſolemnly I ſhould be no Body's but his. He receiv'd this Aſſurance in the ſame manner as if he had receiv'd his perfect Felicity; but he knew well the Dolor I conceiv'd thereat: I became Pale, my Eyes were covered with Tears; and when we were about leaving him, he deſired me to draw near to him; he told me with a languiſhing Tone: <hi>fear nothing,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana; <hi>I love you too well to diſpleaſe you; you ſhall have</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez, <hi>ſeeing your Affections are engaged to him.</hi> I anſwer'd him: <hi>I had no particular Inclination for him; but being commanded to reſpect him, as a Man who was to be my Husband, I could do no otherwiſe; however, I intreated him to be well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeem'd to me the leaſt ſtep I could take towards a Perſon to whom I had ſo great Obligations. He appear'd thereat ſufficiently ſatisfy'd, attempting to take my Hand and kiſs it: <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>you enjoyn me to live; and that my Life being your Work, you will be oblig'd to conſerve it.</hi> We return'd at Night, and the Impatient <hi>Mendez</hi> waited for us, to make me new Reproaches: I took 'em as I was wont, as Proofs of his Paſſion: and having juſtified my ſelf, I askt him, What News there was of the Fleet? <hi>Alas!</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>my Father has receiv'd ſuch as drives me to Deſpair: I dare not inform you. Have you any thing ſeparate from me?</hi> ſaid I to him, looking tenderly on him: <hi>Would you have me to be reſerv'd to you? I am too Happy,</hi> replied he, <hi>in that you have ſuch favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſpoſitions; and being not able to keep any Secret from you, I muſt plainly tell you, That the Galion in which is is our whole Eſtate, is ſplit and loſt, running againſt a Rock. But I ſhould be leſs ſenſible, how greatly ſoever I am Intereſt, did I not look on
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151523:39"/> the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Conſequences of this Loſs: Your Preſence will reſtore the Marqueſs</hi> de Los Rios <hi>to his Health; his Sentiments for you are known in your Family; he is Rich, and a great Lord: I become Miſerable; and if you forſake me, my dear</hi> Mariana, <hi>I ſhall have no more Hope but in a ſpeedy Death.</hi> I was pierced with Sorrow at this ſad News: I took one of his Hands, and cloſing it with mine, I ſaid to him, <hi>My dear</hi> Mendez, <hi>do not think me capable of loving you, and yet leaving you, by the Effects of your good or bad Fortune: if you be able to bear up againſt it, believe me ſo too. I call Heaven to witneſs,</hi> continued I, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you love me, and be faithful to me, that I will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you; and let it puniſh me if ever I prove Inconſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He teſtified all the Acknowledgements he ought me for ſuch affectionate Aſſurances, and we reſolved not to divulge this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p>I withdrew very melancholly, and ſhut my ſelf up in my Cloſet, ruminating on the Conſequences of this ſad Diſaſter. I was ſtill there, when I heard ſome Body knocking ſoftly at the Shutters of my Window: I drew near, and ſaw <hi>Mendez</hi> by the Light of the Moon: <hi>What do you here,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>at this time of the Night? Alas,</hi> anſwer'd he to me, <hi>I was trying whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I could ſpeak with you before I departed: My Father has again lately received News of the Galion, and will have me immediately go where ſhe is run a-ground, to endeavour to ſave ſomething: It is a great way thither, and I ſhall be a great while without ſeeing you. Ah, dear</hi> Mariana, <hi>during all this time will you be as good as your Word to me? May I hope my dear Mistreſs will be faithful to me? What Reaſon have I given you, Mendez,</hi> ſaid I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, <hi>to doubt it? Yes,</hi> continued I, <hi>I will love you were you the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate Man in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be to abuſe your Patience, Madam, to relate to you whatſoever we ſaid in this doleful Separation; and though there appear'd no Danger, yet our Hearts had a foreboding of what was afterwards to happen to us. The Day began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and we muſt bid Adieu: I ſaw him ſhed Tears, which were accompanied with mine.</p>
               <p>I threw my ſelf on my Bed, rowling a thouſand ſad Thoughts in my Mind; and I appear'd the next Morning ſo out of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that my Father and Mother were afraid I was falling into ſome dangerous fit of Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mendez</hi> his Father came to make them a Viſit, to excuſe his Son's parting without taking his Leave of them. He added, <hi>He had a Buſineſs which required ſuch haſte, as would not ſuffer him a Minute's time at his diſpoſal.</hi> As to my ſelf, Madam, I was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151523:39"/> comfortleſs, being inſenſible to every thing. And if any thing could eaſe me, 'twas ſome hours Converſation with my dear <hi>Henrietta,</hi> with whom I freely vented my Thoughts touching the long Abſence of <hi>Mendez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios</hi> was out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and my Father went often to ſee him: I obſerv'd one day great Alteration on my Mother's Countenance, ſhe and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having been long ſhut up with Religioſes, who came to give 'em a Viſit; and after a Conference of ſome time, they call'd me, without my being able to divine the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>I entred into their Apartment in ſuch Diſorder, that I knew not what I did. One of theſe good Fathers, Venerable by his Age and Habit, ſpake much to me about the Reſignation we owe to the Divine Will, on his Providence, in every thing which relates to us: and the Cloſe of his Diſcourſe was, That <hi>Mendez</hi> was taken by the <hi>Algerines;</hi> that he was a Slave; and by his Misfortunes theſe Pyrates had learnt he was a rich Merchant's Son; which had occaſion'd the ſetting him at an extraordinary Ranſom: That they were at <hi>Algiers</hi> in the time he arriv'd; would have willingly brought him along with 'em, but the Money which they had for all, was not ſufficient for him alone. That at their Return they had been at his Father's to inform him of this vexatious Diſaſter; but found he had abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that the loſs of a Galion, on which was embarkt all his Effects, without being able to ſave any thing, had induced him to avoid his Creditors, who ſought him every-where, to throw him in Priſon. That things being in this Condition, they ſaw no Remedy to poor <hi>Mendez</hi> his Misfortunes, being in the hands of <hi>Meluza</hi> the moſt famous and covetous of all the Corſaries; and that if I would follow their Advice, and that of my Parents, I would think of taking another Party. I had ſo far heard this dreadful News in ſo ecſtatic a Condition, that I could only interrupt them by ſad Sighs; but when he told me, I muſt think of another Party; I burſt out with Tears and Shrieks, as made both my Father and Mother, and theſe Religioſes compaſſionate me.</p>
               <p>I was carried into my Chamber as one nearer death than life; and <hi>Donna Henrietta</hi> was ſent for, and it was not without great Affliction ſhe beheld me in this ſad Condition. I fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a moſt deep Melancholly; I tormented my ſelf day and night, and nothing was able to remove my dear <hi>Mendez</hi> out of my Mind.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:151523:40"/>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios,</hi> having learnt what had paſt, conceiv'd ſuch ſtrong Hopes, that he ſoon found himſelf in a Condition to come and Claim of my Father and me the Effect of the Words we had given him. I ſhewed him that mine were not diſengaged in reſpect of <hi>Mendez;</hi> that he was Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, which no ways leſſen'd my Engagements to him. He heard me without being perſwaded by me, and told me, I had the ſame deſire of deſtroying my ſelf, as others had of ſaving themſelves; that 'twas more my Intereſt than his, which made him act as he did. And being raviſht with having a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which ſeemed to him plauſible, he preſt my Father with ſuch Earneſtneſs, that he at length conſented to what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for me to repreſent to you, Madam, in what an Abyſs of Sorrow I was in: <hi>What is become my Lord,</hi> ſaid I to the Marqueſs, <hi>of that ſcrupulous Tenderneſs which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd you from taking my Heart from any other hand than my own? Let me at leaſt have ſome time to forget</hi> Mendez; <hi>Perhaps his Abſence and Misfortunes may prevail on me to ſome Indifferency towards him. To this cruel Accident, which has ſnatch'd him ſo lately from me, you add new Troubles when you expect I ſhould ſo ſpeedily paſs over from him to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know not what I expect or may hope for,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>but this I am ſure of, that my Complaiſance had like to have coſt me my Life; that if you be not deſign'd for me, you will be anothers; and as to</hi> Mendez, <hi>his Fortune has been ſuch, that he can no longer pretend to you; and ſeeing you muſt be diſpoſed of, I think you are very hard hearted to refuſe me. You cannot be ignorant of what I have done hitherto to pleaſe you, my former Proceeding ſhould ſerve as a ſufficient Teſtimony of my future Reſpects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqueſs made a greater progreſs in my Father's Mind than mine. In a Word, my Mother having one day ſent for me, told me, 'Twas to no purpoſe to uſe any longer Delays, my Father being reſolv'd I ſhould obey his Orders. Whatever I could ſay to excuſe my ſelf, my Tears, my Remonſtrances, Entreaties were all to no purpoſe, and ſerv'd only to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my Mother.</p>
               <p>All things neceſſary were prepared for my Marriage, the Marqueſs would have every thing ſuitable to his Quality; He ſent me a Cabinet of Jewels and Precious Stones, to the value of ſeveral thouſand Crowns. The fatal Day for our Wedding was ſet. Seeing my ſelf reduced to this Extremity, I took a reſolution which will ſurpriſe you, Madam, and demonſtrate a great Paſſion.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:151523:40"/>
               <p>I went to <hi>Donna Henrietta;</hi> this Friend had been ever faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me, and threw my ſelf at her feet, ſurpriſing her by ſo extraordinary a Carriage: My dear <hi>Henrietta,</hi> ſaid I to her, melting in Tears, <hi>there is no Remedy to my Misfortunes, unleſs you have pity on me; do not abandon me, let me conjure you in the ſad Condition I am in; to morrow I muſt marry the Marqueſs</hi> de Los Rios, <hi>I can no longer avoid it. If the Offers of Friendſhip you have made me be Proof againſt all Tryal, and can make you capable of a generous Reſolution, you will not refuſe to follow my Fortune, and to accompany me to</hi> Algiers <hi>to pay</hi> Mendez <hi>his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, to redeem him from the cruel Slavery he is in. You ſee me at your Feet,</hi> continued I, <hi>I will never riſe till you have given me your Word, to do what I deſire you.</hi> She ſeem'd ſo concern'd at my Poſture, that I aroſe to make her anſwer me. She immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately embraced me with great Teſtimonies of Tenderneſs: <hi>I will refuſe you nothing, my dear</hi> Mariana, ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>were it my very Life; but you are going to ruine your ſelf and me with you. How can two Girls execute what you project? Our Age, our Sex, and your Beauty, will expoſe us to Accidents, the bare ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of which makes me to tremble: this is certain, we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to overwhelm our Families with Shame and Confuſion; and if you had made ſerious Reflections hereon, it is not poſſible you could have come to this Reſolution. Ah, barbarous!</hi> cried I, <hi>and more barbarous than he that detains my Lover; you forſake me, but tho' I am alone, yet that ſhall not hinder me from purſuing my Point, neither can the aſſiſtance you ſhould give me stand me in much stead: Remain, remain, I conſent, it is fit I ſhould depart without any Comfort to affront all Dangers; I confeſs ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is fit only for a deſperate Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Reproaches and Tears moved <hi>Henrietta;</hi> ſhe told me my Intereſt had obliged her as much as her own to ſpeak to me as ſhe had done; but in ſhort, ſeeing I perſiſted in my firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and nothing could divert me from it, ſhe was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I ſhould not go alone; That if I would be ruled by her, we ſhould diſguiſe our ſelves; that ſhe would undertake to get two Suits of Mens Apparel; and as for the reſt, it belong'd to me to take care of it. I embraced her with a thouſand Teſtimonies of Thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>I afterwards askt her, Whether ſhe had ſeen the Jewels which the Marqueſs had ſent me; <hi>I will bring them,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>to purchaſe</hi> Mendez<hi>'s Ranſom with them.</hi> We reſolv'd to loſe no time, and we neither of us fail'd in what we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:151523:41"/>
               <p>Never were two Maidens better diſguiſed under the Habit of two Cavaliers. We parted that Night, and embarkt, our ſelves without the leaſt Obſtacle, but after ſome days Sail we were overtaken by ſo violent a Storm, as made us deſpair of our Safety. In all this Diſorder and Peril, I was leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my ſelf, than for not having compaſſed my dear <hi>Mendez</hi>'s Liberty, and for having engaged <hi>Henrietta</hi> to follow my ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: <hi>It is I,</hi> ſaid I to her, in embracing her, <hi>it is I, my dear Companion, that has rais'd this Storm, were I not on the Sea it would be Calm; my Misfortune follows me wherever I go.</hi> In fine, we having been a Day and two Nights in continual Alarums, the Weather chang'd, and we arriv'd at <hi>Algiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was ſo glad to ſee my ſelf in a Condition to deliver <hi>Mendez,</hi> that I reckon'd all the Dangers we underwent as nothing: But alas, what became of me in diſembarking, when after all the ſearch which could be made, I perceiv'd there was no hope of finding the little Cabinet wherein I had put all I had was moſt precious: I found my ſelf ſeiz'd with ſuch violent Grief, that I thought I ſhould have expired before I got out of the Veſſel. Without doubt this Cabinet, which was little, and of which I took but ſmall Care during the Tempeſt, fell into the Sea, or was ſtole, which ever of theſe two it was, I had a conſiderable Loſs, and I had only remaining Jewels to the value of a thouſand Pounds, which I had kept for all Events about me.</p>
               <p>I reſolv'd with this, to make a Tryal with <hi>Mendez</hi>'s Patron: As ſoon as we were in the Town, we enquired out his Houſe, (for <hi>Meluza</hi> was well known) and went thither clad as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs to you, Madam, the trouble I was in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near this Houſe, where I knew my dear Lover languiſht in Chains; what ſad Reflections did I not make; how did I look when I enter'd the Corſary's Houſe, and ſaw <hi>Mendez</hi> Chain'd, with ſeveral others, who were leading out to work in the Field. I ſhould have fallen at his Feet, had not <hi>Henrietta</hi> born me up: I no longer knew where I was, nor what I did; I would have ſpoken to him, but Grief had ſo ſeiz'd on my Spirits, that my Tongue could not utter a Word. As to him, he beheld me not; he was ſo ſad and depreſt, that he could look on no body; and one muſt love him as much as I did, to know him, ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was he changed.</p>
               <p>After having been ſome time coming to my ſelf, I went into a low Room, where I was told <hi>Meluza</hi> was; I ſaluted him, and told him the occaſion of my Voyage; that <hi>Mendez</hi> was my near
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151523:41"/> Relation; that he was undone by the Loſs of a Galion, and his Captivity together; and that 'twas out of my own Money that I would pay his Ranſom. The <hi>Moor</hi> appear'd to me little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at what I ſaid; and looking ſcornfully on me, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, It was not his buſineſs to enquire whence I had my Money; but this he certainly knew, that <hi>Mendez</hi> was Rich; and to ſhew that he would not take all Advantages, he would therefore ſet him at twenty thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>Alas, what would this have been, had I not loſt my Jewels? but this was too much in the Condition I was in. In fine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral long fruitleſs Diſputes, I took on me immediately a reſolution which could only be inſpired by an extream Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here's all I have,</hi> ſaid I to the Pyrate, in giving him my Diamonds, <hi>they are not worth what thou demandeſt: take me for thy Slave, and be perſwaded thou wilt not keep me long. I am the only Daughter of a Rich Banker of</hi> Seville; <hi>keep me for an Hoſtage, and let</hi> Mendez <hi>go; he will ſoon return to Redeem me.</hi> The <hi>Barbarian</hi> was ſurpriz'd to find me capable of ſo generous and affectionate a Reſolution. <hi>Thou art worthy,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>of a better Fortune. Be it ſo; I accept the Condition you offer me: I will take care of thee, and be a good Patron to thee. Thou muſt leave the Habit thou weareſt, to put on one agreeable to thy Sex: thou ſhalt keep thy Jewels if thou wilt, I can as well ſtay for the whole as for a part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Donna Henrietta</hi> was ſo confuſed and diſmayed at the Bargain I came from concluding, that ſhe could not ſufficiently expreſs her Diſpleaſure to me; but in fine, maugre all her Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances and Entreaties, I held firm, and <hi>Meluza</hi> caus'd a Slave's Habit to be brought me, which I put on.</p>
               <p>He conducted me to his Wives Chamber, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd me, having recounted to her what I had done for my Lover's Liberty.</p>
               <p>She ſeem'd to be much effected with it, and promis'd ſhe would ſhorten the time of my Servitude by all the good Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe could make me.</p>
               <p>At Night, when <hi>Mendez</hi> return'd, <hi>Meluza</hi> caus'd him to be call'd, telling him, That being of <hi>Seville,</hi> he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhew him a Slave he had bought, becauſe perhaps he might know her.</p>
               <p>Immediately I was brought before him; <hi>Mendez</hi> at this ſight, loſing all Countenance, came and caſt himſelf at my Feet, and taking my Hands, which he bathed with his Tears, he ſaid every thing which was moſt tender and affectionate to me.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151523:42"/> 
                  <hi>Meluza</hi> and his Wife diverted themſelves, in ſeeing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Motions of Joy and Grief with which we were agitated: in fine, they inform'd <hi>Mendez</hi> of the Obligations he had to me; that he was free, and that I would remain in his place. He did whatever could be done to diſſwade me from taking this Task on me: <hi>Alas,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>you would have me load you with my Chains, my dear Miſtreſs; Shall I be free, when you are not? I go then to do for you what you come from doing for me; I will ſell my ſelf, and Redeem you with this Money: for in fine, conſider, that ſhould I as ſoon as I arrive at</hi> Seville, <hi>find Aſſiſtance, and return again to bring you back, yet how is it poſſible for me in the mean time to leave you; judge how I can do this in a time wherein my Fortune promiſes me nothing, and am the most <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all Men.</hi> I offered againſt all his Reaſons, the Tenderneſs of my Father, who would ſoon Redeem me when he knew where I was. In fine, I made uſe of all the Power I had over his Mind, to make his Advantage of what I had done in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay to you, Madam, of our Separation? It was ſo dolorous, that Words cannot expreſs what we felt. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Henrietta</hi> to part with him, to ſollicite and preſs my Parents to do their part in my behalf.</p>
               <p>In the mean time my Father and Mother were in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Affliction and when they perceiv'd my flight, they thought to die with Grief.</p>
               <p>They blamed themſelves infinitely for forcing me to marry the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios.</hi> He was for his part in no leſs Deſpair; they cauſed me to be ſearcht for in vain, in all places where they thought I might have hid my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Two whole Years were paſt without my receiving any News or Succors from <hi>Mendez;</hi> which made me believe with great likelihood, that both he and <hi>Henrietta</hi> were caſt away on the Sea: I had given them all the Jewels which <hi>Meluza</hi> had left me; but it was not their Loſs, nor that of my Liberty, which I regretted: It was of my dear Lover and faithful Friend, whoſe Remembrance continually poſſeſt me, and caus'd me an unparallel'd Affliction; I could get no Reſt nor Health; I wept Day and Night; I refuſed to come out of my Slavery in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to ſignifie to my Father my preſent Condition. I wiſht only for a ſpeedy Death, which I would have willingly met with, to put an end to my Troubles and Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meluza</hi> and his Wife began to pity me: they did not doubt but <hi>Mendez,</hi> was caſt away: they treated me leſs cruelly, than theſe ſort of People are wont to uſe thoſe Unhappy Wretches, who fall into their Hands.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:151523:42"/>
               <p>One Day, as <hi>Meluza</hi> came from Pyrating he brought with him ſeveral Perſons of both Sexes which he had taken, and among the reſt a Young Woman of ſome Quality of <hi>Seville,</hi> and whom I knew. This ſight renewed my Grief: ſhe was much ſurpris'd to find me in this ſad place. We affectionately embraced one another, and obſerving a deep ſilence; <hi>How now, Beautiful</hi> Mariana, ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>are you ſo indifferent towards your Relations and Country, that you have no Curioſity to make any Enquiries about them?</hi> I lifted up mine Eyes to Heaven in uttering a deep Sigh; I entreated her to tell me, If 'twere known where <hi>Mendez</hi> and <hi>Henrietta</hi> were loſt? <hi>Who has told you they are loſt?</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>they are at</hi> Seville, <hi>where they lead a very happy Life.</hi> Mendez <hi>has re-eſtabliſht his Affairs, and makes it his great Delight and Honour to publiſh in all places the Extream Obligations he has to</hi> Henrietta. <hi>Perhaps you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>that</hi> Mendez <hi>was taken and made a Slave by the</hi> Algerines; <hi>this generous young Woman diſguiſed her ſelf, and came hither to redeem him, but he has not been ungrateful, for he has married her. There is a moſt charming <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between them.</hi> Hymen <hi>has not baniſht Love in their particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſhe was yet ſpeaking, ſhe perceiv'd my Countenance to alter on a ſudden, and that I was ready to faint; my Strength fail'd me, mine Eyes cloſed, and I ſunk down between her Arms; ſhe was greatly troubled at this; ſhe called my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who put me to Bed, and endeavour'd to recover me from this pitious Condition.</p>
               <p>This young Woman greatly concern'd her ſelf for me; and when I came to my ſelf, I began to complain; I uttered Sighs and Groans, able to move a Rock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meluza</hi> was affected at the Recital of ſuch a worſe than bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Inſtance of Treachery, and without any notice to me, he inform'd himſelf, by his new Slave of my Father's Name, and immediately wrote to him what he knew of my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters were like to have been the Death of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe could not imagine I could be in Chains at eighteen Years of Age, without ſhedding a torrent of Tears: But that which augmented her Grief, was, the Diſorder of my Father's Affairs; ſeveral conſiderable Bankrupts had ruined him; his Credit was gone, and it was impoſſible for him to procure the 20000 Crowns which <hi>Meluza</hi> demanded for my Ranſom.</p>
               <p>The Generous Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios</hi> heard this News, came to my Father, and offered him what lay in his Power: <hi>I do not do this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in deſign to force your Daughter's Inclinations
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151523:43"/> when ſhe ſhall be here; I ſhall love her always, but I will never diſpleaſe her.</hi> My Father having no other way of Relief, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted of what was offered him; and in a word, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkt himſelf, and happily arriv'd at <hi>Argiers,</hi> in the time when I thought only of dying.</p>
               <p>He forbore all thoſe Reproaches I deſerv'd; he redeem'd me, and at my Intreaty, this young Woman of <hi>Seville,</hi> for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Ranſom. We return'd together, and my Mother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd me with ſuch Joy as is impoſſible to be expreſt. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd hereto as much as was poſſible; but I carried always in my Heart, Madam, the fatal Stroke which had wounded me: Whatever my Reaſon could repreſent to me, was not ſufficient to eface out of my Remembrance the Image of the Traitor <hi>Mendez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaw the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Rios:</hi> he dared not mention the Inclinations he ſtill had towards me; but I had ſuch preſſing Obligations to him, that Gratitude made me do for him, what my Inclinations would have made me do for another.</p>
               <p>I gave him my Hand, and he his to me, with ſuch Affection, as if he had had no ſolid Matter of Complaint againſt me.</p>
               <p>In fine, I married him, and apprehending leſt I ſhould ſee <hi>Mendez,</hi> that Ungrateful Wretch, to whom I owe ſuch Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and for whom I had ſo little, I pray'd the Marqueſs we might dwell in the Country-houſe he had near <hi>Seville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ever approv'd of what I liked; he would have my Father and Mother retire; he leſs'ned the ſad Condition of their Fortune, by conſiderable Liberalities: and I may truly ſay, there never was a greater Soul. Judge, Madam, of all the Reproaches I made my Heart for its not being ſo tender to him as it ought to have been: It was not in my power to forget <hi>Mendez,</hi> and I always felt new Regrets, when I learnt his Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city with the Unfaithful <hi>Henrietta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having paſt two Years in a continual watching over my ſelf, that I might do nothing but what was agreeable to my Husband, Heaven depriv'd me of him, of this Generous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and he did for me in theſe laſt Moments, what he had already heretofore done, giving me all he had, with ſuch Teſtimonies of Eſteem and Affection, as much enhanced the Price of the Gift: He made me the richeſt Widow of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſia,</hi> but he could not make me the Happieſt.</p>
               <p>I would not return to <hi>Seville,</hi> where my Parents would have had me been; and to avoid it, I pretended a Journey farther into the Country, to look after ſome part of my Eſtate. I ſet out; but there being a particular Fatality in whatever relates
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151523:43"/> to me, in arriving at an Inn, the firſt Object which ſtruck my ſight, was the Unfaithful <hi>Mendez:</hi> he was in deep Mourning, and had loſt nothing of whatever made me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore fancy him too Lovely. It is impoſſible to expreſs the Condition I was in, for endeavouring to get ſpeedily from him, I found my ſelf ſo weak and trembling, that I fell at his Feet. Although he knew me not at that inſtant, yet he earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to raiſe me up; but the great Veil under which I was conceal'd, flying open, what became of him in ſeeing me? He remain'd no leſs confuſed than I was: he would have drawn near to me, but caſting a furious Look on him: <hi>Dareſt thou, Perjured Wretch!</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>dareſt thou approach me! Art thou not afraid of the juſt Puniſhment of thy Perfidiouſneſs?</hi> He was ſome time without anſwering me, and I was about leaving him when he ſtopt me: <hi>Confound and over-whelm me with Reproaches, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to me: <hi>Give me the worſt and most perfidious Names as is poſſible; they cannot be more than I deſerve: But my Death ſhall ſoon revenge your Quarrel: I ought to die with Sorrow for having betray'd you; and if I regret any thing in dying, it is only the having one Life to loſe, to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all the Crimes you can juſtly accuſe me of.</hi> He appear'd to me much affected in ending theſe words; and would to Heavens his Repentance were really ſufficient and true! I would not hazard a longer Converſation with him: I left him, diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to return him an Anſwer. And this Mark of Contempt and Slighting, was, without doubt, more ſenſible to him, than all the Reproaches I might have made him.</p>
               <p>He had ſome time ſince loſt his Wife, that Unfaithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who had helpt him to Revolt againſt all the Offices of Love, Honour, and Gratitude. And from that time he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me every-where: he was like a Complaining Shadow, ever faſtned to my Feet; for he became ſo lean, pale, and chang'd, that he was no longer diſcernable. Heavens! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, what Violence did I not offer my ſelf, in continuing to ill Treat him: I found at laſt I wanted Strength to reſiſt the Weakneſs of my Heart, and the Aſcendant this Wretch had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me. Rather than to commit ſo ſhameful an Offence, and to Forgive him, I parted for <hi>Madrid,</hi> where I have Relations, and ſought among them a Shelter againſt the Violence of mine own Inclinations.</p>
               <p>I was not there long but <hi>Mendez</hi> found me out: I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, I was not heartily diſpleas'd at his Attendance on me; but maugre my Inclinations towards him, I put on a firm Reſolution to avoid him, ſeeing I could not ſincerely hate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151523:44"/> him; and unknown to every Body, I took the Road to <hi>Burgos'</hi> where I am going to Cloyſter my ſelf with a Religious there, my Friend. I flatter my ſelf, Madam, with the Hopes of finding more Reſt there, than I have hitherto met with.</p>
               <p>The Beautiful Marchioneſs here held her peace; and I teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to her my particular Acknowledgments for the Favour ſhe had done me: I aſſured her of the part I took in her Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: I conjured her to write to me, and to let me hear from her at <hi>Madrid;</hi> and ſhe promiſed it me in the moſt obliging manner as is poſſible.</p>
               <p>We found the next Morning we could not ſet out, it having ſnow'd all the Night, and no Path appearing on the Ground; but we wanted not Company to paſs the time in Play and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Having been three days with the Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Rios,</hi> without any Wearineſs at the length of the Time, through the pleaſure I had of ſeeing and hearing her talk, (for ſhe is one of the moſt lovely Women in the World:) We parted with a mutual Regret, and it was not without doubling our Promiſes of writing to, and ſeeing one another hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Weather mended, and I continued on my Journey to <hi>Lerma:</hi> We had traverſt dreadful Mountains, which bear the Name of <hi>Sierra de Cogollos,</hi> and it was not without great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we got thither: This Town is ſmall; ſhe has given her Name to the famous Cardinal <hi>de Lerma,</hi> Chief Miniſter to <hi>Philip</hi> III: it is from him that <hi>Philip</hi> IV. took the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues he had receiv'd from the King his Maſter. Here is a Caſtle which I will ſee to Morrow, and of which I ſhall give you an Account in my next, I am told an Extraordinary Expreſs is arriv'd, and will ſet out to Night: I will lay hold of this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſending to you, and ending this long Letter; for in truth I am tired both with the Way, and with Writing, but I ſhall never be weary of Loving you.</p>

               <head>LETTER. V.</head>
               <p>MY Laſt was ſo long, and I was ſo weary when I ended it, that I could not add ſome Particulars, which probably might not have been unwelcome to you. I proceed then (dear Kinſwoman) ro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them, ſeeing you ſo much deſire it.</p>
               <p>I arrived late at <hi>Lerma,</hi> and reſolved to tarry ſome time to ſee the Caſtle, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo highly eſteem, that they prize it next the <hi>Eſcurial;</hi> and it is indeed a very fine place. The Cardinal <hi>de Lerma, Philip</hi> the Third's Favorite, was its Founder. It ſtands on the ſide of an Hill, and in your way to it you muſt paſs through a ſpacious place, ſurrounded with Arches and Galleries about it. This Caſtle conſiſts of four vaſt Piles of building, which makes a compleat Quadrangle of two Ranges of Porches within the Court, which are near as high as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151523:45"/> the Roof, and hinder the Apartments from Proſpects on that ſide. The Windows of all the Chambers look forward into the Country; the Rooms are ſpacious, and the Lodgings very fine and curiouſly gilt. There are a prodigious number of them, and very well furniſh't. Near the Caſtle you have a great Park which extends it ſelf along the Plain, through which runs a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſeveral leſſer Springs: On the ſide of the River, there are rows of great Trees, and not far hence a Wood, ſo that, I believe, in fine weather this is a delightful place.</p>
               <p>The Keeper of the Caſtle ask't me, whether I would ſee the Religioſes, whoſe Convent is adjoyning thereunto. I told him moſt willingly; ſo that he made us paſs through a Gallery, at the end of which you meet with a Grate which reaches from top to bottom. The Abbeſs, having been advertiſed of it, came here with ſeveral Religioſes, who were very entertaining, handſom, witty and young, and diſcourſing with great exactneſs of every thing. I was not weary of their Converſation, when a young Girl came and whiſpered the Abbeſs in the Ear, who afterwards told me there was a Lady of great Quality, who had retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Houſe, being the Daughter of Don <hi>Mandrica de Lara,</hi> Count <hi>de Valine,</hi> and eldeſt Son to the Duke <hi>de Naxara;</hi> That ſhe was Widow of Don <hi>Franciſco Fernandez de Castro,</hi> Count <hi>de Lemos,</hi> Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Duke <hi>de Taureſano;</hi> that when ſhe knew of <hi>French</hi> Ladies paſſing through <hi>Lerma,</hi> ſhe was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous of Entertaining them. I made anſwer, I ſhould be glad of the honour of ſeeing her: Whereupon this young Girl was ſent to her.</p>
               <p>This Lady ſoon came in a Dreſs uſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> this hundred years; ſhe had a kind of Pattins on, or rather Stilts, which made her look prodigious Tall, ſo that ſhe was fain to lean on two perſons ſhoulders when ſhe moved. She leaned likewiſe on two Daughters of the Marquis <hi>del Carpio;</hi> one of them is of a very fair Complexion, which is rare in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the others Hair is as black as Jet. Their Beauty ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me, and they wanted only, in my mind, to be a little fat. But this is not reckon'd a Defect in this Country, where they fancy leanneſs ſo much, that they deſire only to have Skin and Bone. The ſingular Dreſs of the Counteſs <hi>de Lemos,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me ſo extraordinary, that I could hardly get mine eyes off of it. She wore a kind of black Sattin Gold embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bodice, and buttoned with great Rubies of conſiderable value. This Bodice came down from her Neck juſt like a Doublet; her Sleeves were ſtrait, with large Wings about her ſhoulders, and other Sleeves hanging as low as her Gown, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151523:45"/> were faſtned on each ſide with Roſes of Diamonds; She had a dreadful Virdingal, which hindred her from ſitting, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then on the Ground. She wore a Ruff, and ſeveral Chains of great Pearls and Diamonds; her Hair was white, which ſhe hid under a Coverture of black Lace, for ſhe was no leſs than 75 years old. She ſeem'd to me to have been a great Beauty in her time; her face had not a wrinkle, and her eyes were ſtill ſparkling, and her white and red Paint became her very well: Her Wit and her Perſonage, as I have been told, were not a little famous in the World. I lookt upon her as a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Piece of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>She told me ſhe had the honour to Accompany the Infanta when ſhe eſpouſed <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth. That ſhe became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> when he was in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> came thither. You have ſeen this Queen, <hi>ſaid I to her, interrupting her,</hi> be pleaſed, Madam, to favour me with a Relation of ſome Particulars of her humor.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent Don <hi>Antonio Pimentel</hi> in quality of Ambaſſador to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> to diſcover, as much as in him lay, the Intentions of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> They had been long Enemies to the Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> and it was not doubted but they would make new Attempts to thwart it, in the deſign of making the Emperour's Son King of the <hi>Romans; Pimentel</hi> was charged to carry on this Affair with great Circumſpection. He was a gallant, witty and handſome Perſon, and he ſucceeded better than could be expected. He immediately diſcovered the Queen's <hi>Genius,</hi> and eaſily made himſelf her Confident. He ſoon perceived ſhe was mightily charm'd with Novelties, and that of the crowd of Strangers which ſhe drew to the Court, the laſt come was the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured. He made it his Task to pleaſe her, and gained ſo far on her Affections, that he became inform'd by her ſelf of the moſt ſecret Affairs, and which ſhe ought the moſt to conceal from him. But what cannot he do, who has found a way to the heart. The Queen's was ſo inclined to him, that he became the ſole Diſpoſer of the Affections of this Princeſs, and by this means was able to write to the Emperour, and to the Electors, things ſo certain and agreeable, as made 'em eaſily judge that the Queen of <hi>Sweedland</hi>'s Council had no part in the Declaration ſhe made in favour of the King of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Intrigue being at an end, 'twas thought the King would recal <hi>Pimentel,</hi> there appearing no occaſion requiring the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an Ambaſſador: But if it were needleſs for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> that he ſhould remain at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> 'twas not the ſame
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151523:46"/> with the Queen, ſhe neglecting nothing whereby to retain him near her. He attended her wherever ſhe went ſince, and many, who were led by outward Appearances, judged when ſhe left the Crown to her Coſin, ſhe did it with great Satisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe did it with dry Eyes, and had the Courage to harangue the States with great Force and Eloquence; but the People were greatly miſtaken in the ſecret Motives of this Princeſs. Her ſoul at that time was pierced with the moſt lovely ſorrow; ſhe was not a little griev'd to yield to the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> a Scepter which ſhe thought her ſelf worthy to wield alone, and of which ſhe was the lawful Heireſs.</p>
               <p>This Prince had the Addreſs to get it declared, that if ſhe married ſhe ſhould chooſe him for her Husband.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as this Declaration was made, ſhe began to feel the weight of the ſubjection wherein ſhe was placed; and on the other hand, the People did not well reliſh the being governed by a Woman. They inſiſted more on her Defects than they minded her Vertues. The Prince contributed under-hand thereto, and the Queen, who was penetrating ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it; ſhe obſerv'd the Inclination the People had to him, and the wiſhes which were made to ſee him on the Throne; ſhe grew every day more and more jealous of this, and paſt from hence to ſuch a deadly Hatred, that 'twas impoſſible for her to ſtop the Courſe of it. The Princes preſence became ſo inſupportable to her, that perceiving it, he withdrew into an Iſland which belong'd to him. But he ſet not out till he had left good <hi>Memoires</hi> to his Creatures againſt the Queen's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>When ſhe ſaw her ſelf deliver'd from an Object, whoſe ſight was ſo great an Eye-ſore, ſhe drew off her Mind from the too intent purſuit of the Affairs of the Kingdom, and gave way to her Inclinations to Books. Her marvellous Wit made, in a ſhort time, admirable Progreſſes in the moſt profound Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but theſe were not ſo needful to her as a good Conduct in the management of her Honour and Intereſt. It often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that having ſpent ſeveral days in her Study, ſhe would appear diſguſted with her Books, ſaying, They were good for nothing but to waſte the Spirits, and miſlead Mens Judgments. When the Great Men of the Court ſaw her in this Diſpoſition, they approacht her with more familiarity, and then the whole Buſineſs was to follow the Pleaſures of Love, of Plays, Balls, Turneys, Huntings, and all other Diverſions. She gave up her ſelf entirely to them, and nothing cou'd bring her off them; but ſhe added to this Defect that of enriching Strangers, at the Expence of her own Subjects.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:151523:46"/>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> began to murmur at this; the Queen was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of it; their Complaints appear'd to be unjuſt, and little reſpectful; and being not a little offended at them, ſhe was ſo unwiſe as to take Vengeance on her ſelf. In effect, at the time when 'twas leaſt expected, and when ſhe was in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to find leſs violent Remedies, ſhe abandoned at one ſtroak her Crown and Kingdom to her Coſin; to this Coſin, I ſay, whom ſhe was ſo far from loving, that ſhe wiſh'd him all the ill ſhe was able; and yet to whom ſhe did ſo much good, ſhe thought 'twas impoſſible for any to penetrate into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this. She pretended by this great ſtroak of Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to diſtinguiſh her ſelf from among the Heroina's of the moſt famous Ages: But in effect, the Conduct ſhe held afterwards, diſtinguiſh'd her only to her Diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>She was ſeen to ſet out from <hi>Swedeland</hi> in a very odd Dreſs for a Woman, with a kind of Juſtaucorps, a ſhort Petticoat, with Boots and Cravat, in a Perriwig, a Hat covered with Feathers, and this Perriwig tied up in a lock behind which ſeem'd then very ridiculous. She forbad all her Women to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fow her, chooſing only Men to ſerve her, and attend her. She was wont ordinarily to ſay, That ſhe did not love Men as Men, but becauſe they were not Women. So that ſhe ſeem'd to have renounc'd her Sex in renouncing her States, altho ſhe had ſometimes ſuch Weakneſſes as wou'd have made the meaneſt Women aſhamed.</p>
               <p>The truſty <hi>Pimentel</hi> paſt over into <hi>Flanders</hi> with her, and I being then there, <hi>continues ſhe,</hi> I ſaw him arrive; he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me the honour to kiſs her hand, and there needed no leſs than his Credit to obtain this; for ſhe ſent word to all the Ladies of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Antwerpt,</hi> ſhe wou'd excuſe them for their Viſits. Yet ſhe receiv'd me very well, and the little ſhe ſaid to me, appear'd full of Wit and extraordinary Vivacity; but ſhe ſwore at every turn like a Souldier, and her Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo free, not to ſay ſo diſhoneſt, that were it not for her Rank, her Perſon wou'd have been little regarded.</p>
               <p>She ſpake before every Body of the paſſionate deſire ſhe had to ſee the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> that his great Actions had charm'd her, and that ſhe was deſirous to learn the Trade of War under him. The Prince had no leſs deſire to ſee her, than ſhe teſtified to ſee him. In the midſt of this mutual Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Queen ſtopt on a ſudden on ſome Formalities and Steps which ſhe refuſed to take, when he ſhou'd come to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her. Theſe Reaſons hindred him from ſeeing her with the uſual Ceremonies. But one day, when the Queen's Chamber
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151523:47"/> was full of Courtiers, the Prince ſlipt therein; whether ſhe had ſeen his Picture, or that his Martial Ayr had diſtinguiſh'd him from among others, ſhe had ſingled him out, and knew him. She wou'd immediately hereupon have teſtifi'd as much to him, by extraordinary Civilities. He preſently retired, and ſhe follow'd to conduct him. Then he ſtopt, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with ſaying theſe words, <hi>Either All, or Nothing.</hi> Some few days after, an Interview was ſet on foot to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the <hi>Mall</hi> in the Park at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where they ſpake together with great Civility and much Coldneſs.</p>
               <p>As to Don <hi>Antonio Pimentel,</hi> the Favours ſhe has had for him, have, made noiſe enough to come to your Ears, and if you be ignorant of 'em, Madam, I believe I ought not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to learn you the Particulars, of which perhaps I my ſelf may have been ill inform'd. She held her peace, and I made my profit of this moment to thank her for complaiſance in giving me an account of a Queen, who had ever giv'n me ſuch a great Curioſity. She askt me afterwards, whether I had ſeen the Caſtle of <hi>Lerma.</hi> He that build it, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite to <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, whoſe Death hapned very ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This Prince, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> was writing Letters in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and it being very cold that day, they had placed very near him a quick fire of Coals, whoſe reverberation ſtruck ſo much on his face, that he was all in water, as if a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it had been poured on his Head. The eaſineſs of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hindred him from complaining, and even ſpeaking of it; for he never found fault with any thing. The Marquis <hi>de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> having obſerv'd the incommodiouſneſs which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by this extream heat, advertiſed the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi>'s Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of his Chamber of it, to the end he might remove the Fire away: He replied, It was not his Office, and that the Duke <hi>Dueſda</hi> ought to be made acquainted with it, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Buſineſs it was. The Marquis <hi>de Pobar</hi> being troubled to ſee the King thus ſuffer, and not daring himſelf to eaſe him, for fear of invading another's Province, left the fire ſtill in its place; but he ſent to give notice of it to the Duke <hi>Dueſda,</hi> who was by Misfortune gone near <hi>Madrid</hi> to ſee a ſtately Houſe he was there building. Word was brought of this again to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Pobar,</hi> who propoſed again to the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> the taking away the fire. But he found him inflexible hereunto, and choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſend into the Country, to the Duke <hi>Dueſda,</hi> ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was come, the King was almoſt ſpent, and that very Night he fell into a violent Fever, accompanied with an Eriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellis, which inflamed, and the Inflamation degenerated into the Purples, which cauſed his Death.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:151523:47"/>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> that having ſeen when I was abroad in the World, other Courts beſides our own, I cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear blaming theſe kind of Ceremonies and Punctilio's which hinder the taking of one ſtep faſter than another, thô life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended thereon. The old Counteſs of <hi>Lemo</hi>'s lov'd to talk, and continuing her Diſcourſe, and among other names mention'd that of the Count <hi>de Villa Mediana,</hi> I have heard, ſaid I, <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her,</hi> that this Gentleman, being one day in the Church of our Lady <hi>d' Arocha,</hi> and finding there a <hi>Religio</hi>'s, who begg'd for the Souls of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he gave him a piece of four pounds. <hi>Ah my, Lord,</hi> ſaid the good Father, <hi>you have now deliver'd a Soul.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> drew out again alike piece, and put it into the Baſon. <hi>Here's,</hi> continued the <hi>Religio, another Soul deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:</hi> He gave him in this manner ſix, one after another, and at the dropping of each piece, the <hi>Monk</hi> cry'd <hi>Here's a Soul deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from</hi> Purgatory. <hi>Will you be poſitive in it,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Count. Yes, my Lord,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Monk, I am certain they are now in</hi> Heav'n. <hi>Give me now then back again my ſix pieces,</hi> ſaid, he, <hi>for they ſignifie nothing to you, ſeeing the Souls are already got to</hi> Heav'n, <hi>there's no danger of their returning again to</hi> Purgatory. It was as you relate, <hi>added the Counteſs,</hi> but he took not again his Money, for this wou'd have been among us an horrid <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> And I knew a man of good quality, who being much behind in the World, yet when he was dying, wou'd have fifteen thouſand Maſſes to be ſaid for him. His laſt Will was executed, and his poor Creditors defrauded; for how juſt ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Debts be, they can expect to receive nothing, till ſuch time as all the Maſſes which are left in the Will be ſaid. And this has given occaſion to that common ſaying among us, <hi>That ſuch a one has made his Soul his Heir;</hi> whereby is meant, that he has left his Eſtate to the <hi>Church</hi> to ſay Prayers for him.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth ordered in his Will an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Maſſes</hi> to be ſaid for him; farther declaring, That ſhou'd he ceaſe needing them, they ſhou'd ſerve for his Father and Mother; and in caſe they were got to <hi>Heav'n,</hi> they ſhou'd be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Souls of thoſe who were ſlain in the Wars of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what I have already told you of the Count <hi>de Villa Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> brings to my mind, that he being one day at Church with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he ſaw a great deal of Money on the Altar, which was giv'n for the Souls in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> He drew near, and took it up in his hand, ſaying, <hi>My Love will laſt for ever, my Pains will be likewiſe</hi> Eternal, <hi>thoſe of the Souls in</hi> Purgatory <hi>will have an end; alas, mine will never end! This hope comforts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151523:48"/> them; as for me, I am without hope and comfort, ſo that theſe Charities are more due to me, than they.</hi> However, he took nothing away, only ſpeaking theſe words as an occaſion to bring in his Paſſion before this beautiful Queen, who was there preſent: For in effect, his was ſo violent for her, that there is ſome reaſon to think ſhe was not wholly inſenſible of it, if her rigid Virtue had not preſerved her heart againſt the Count's Merit. He was young, well ſhaped, handſome, brave, magnificent, gallant and witty; every Body knows how he appeared to his Misfortune in a <hi>Caroſel</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a Suit embroidered with pieces of new Money, called <hi>Realles,</hi> and which he bore for a Device;
<q>MIS AMORES SON REALES.</q> making an alluſion to the word <hi>Reales,</hi> which is to ſay <hi>Royal,</hi> with the Paſſion he had for the Queen. This is finer in <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> and ſignifies in <hi>Engliſh, My Love is Royal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Count Duke <hi>d' Olivarez,</hi> the Kings Favorite, and the ſecret Enemy of the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Count,</hi> made his Maſter take notice of the boldneſs of a Subject, who dared even in his Preſence declare the Sentiments he had for the <hi>Queen;</hi> and in this moment he perſwaded the King to be reveng'd on him. An occaſion was waited for which ſhou'd make no noiſe. But here's what haſtned his ruine; applying his Mind only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Queen,</hi> he wrote a <hi>Comedy</hi> which every Body likes, and the <hi>Queen,</hi> more than others, found therein ſuch moving and delicate ſtroaks in it, that ſhe wou'd act apart in it her ſelf on the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Birth-day.</hi> It was the Amorous Count who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged and took care of the Feſtival; he ordered the Cloaths, and provided Machines, which coſt him above Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns. He had cauſed a great <hi>Cloud</hi> to be painted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the <hi>Queen</hi> was concealed in a Machine. He ſtood very near it, and at a certain ſign he gave a Man who was faithful to him, he ſet fire to the linnen work of the Cloud. The whole Houſe, valued at an hundred thouſand Crowns, was in a manner conſumed; but he comforted himſelf, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his advantage of this favourable Opportunity, he took his Soveraign in his Arms, carry'd her into a little by-place, and there ſtole from her ſome Favours; and that which is much taken notice of in this Country, is that he touched her foot. A little Page who ſaw him, inform'd the Count Duke of it, he did not doubt but when he ſaw the fire, but this was an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151523:48"/> effect of the Count's Paſſion. He made ſuch an exact En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that he laid before the King certain Proofs of it; and his Proofs ſo greatly enraged the King, that 'tis pretended he cauſed him to be ſhot with a Piſtol one night, as he was in his Coach with Don <hi>Lewis de Haro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's a very Tragical end, <hi>ſaid I to her, interrupting her;</hi> but whilſt, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I am ſpeaking to you of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, I cannot but I muſt tell you, that he was vehemently in love with the Dutcheſs <hi>Dalburkerke.</hi> He cou'd never meet with a favourable opportunity of Entertaining her. The Duke her Husband kept ſtrict guard over her, and the more Obſtacles the King met with, the more his Deſires increaſed; but when Night came, and when he was at play, he feign'd to call to mind he had a Letter to write of the greateſt conſequence. He call'd the Duke <hi>Dalburkerke,</hi> who was in his Chamber, and deſired him to take his place, and continue his Game. He immediately hereupon entred into his Cloſet, diſguiſed himſelf, and went down by a back Stairs, and came to the young Dutcheſs with the Count Duke his Favorite.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>Dalburkerke,</hi> whoſe mind ran on his Domeſtick Intereſts more then on his Game, eaſily believ'd his Maſter wou'd not have committed it to him, without ſome ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. He began then to complain of an horrid Collick, and uttering Cries and making Faces enough to fright one, he gave the Cards to another, and without any ſtop run home. The King had only juſt arrived there without any Train, he was then in the Court, and ſeeing the Duke come he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but there is nothing ſo clear ſighted as a jealous Husband. He perceiv'd the King, and being not willing to have Lights brought that he might not be oblig'd to acknowledge him, he made up to him with a great Cane which he commonly walked with: <hi>Ha! Ha! Villain,</hi> ſaid, he to him, <hi>thou comeſt to rob my Houſe;</hi> and without more words he laid on him with all his ſtrength. The Count Duke was no more ſpared, who fearing leaſt worſe might happen, cried, out ſeveral times, <hi>'Twas the King,</hi> to ſtop the Duke's Fury: but this was ſo far from ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it, that he redoubled his blows both on the Prince and his Miniſter, crying in his turn, <hi>That this was a ſtroak of the greateſt Inſolence, to make uſe of his Majeſty's Name and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites in ſuch an occaſion, that he could find in his heart to ſend 'em to the Palace, becauſe he well knew the King would cauſe 'em to be hang'd.</hi> In all this Fray the King ſaid not a word, and at length got away half mad, in having received ſo many blows, and not one favour from his Miſtreſs.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:151523:49"/>
               <p>This produced no ill Conſequences to the Duke <hi>Dalburkerke;</hi> but on the contrary the King being cured of his Love to the Dutcheſs, made a Jeſt of it ſome time after. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I do not abuſe your patience by the length of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>added the Counteſs</hi> de Lemos, and I fall inſenſible into the defect of perſons of my Age, who forget themſelves when they tell of things done in their time. I ſaw ſhe was for retiring, and having again thankt her for the honour ſhe had done me, I took my leave of her, and returned to my Inn.</p>
               <p>The Weather was ſo foul, that we with great difficulty ſet out, but being reſolv'd on it, we marcht as long as the day laſted, falling down and getting up as well as we cou'd. We cou'd hardly ſee four Paces before us, the Storm was ſo great, that it blew off ſeveral Stones off the Rocks, which fell into our way, and hurt one of our Company; he had been kill'd, had he not ſtept on one ſide. In fine, after having made about eight Leagues, according to our reckoning, we were much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht to find our ſelves at the Gates of <hi>Lerma,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced or gone back. We had ſtill turn'd about the Town, without perceiving it, as it were by Enchantment, ſometimes farther, ſometimes nearer, and we were all of us not a little out of humor at having taken ſo much pains to ſo little purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Hoſteſs tranſported at the ſight of us, ſhe who cou'd have been glad with all her heart we ſhou'd thus Travel as long as we lived, to return to lye at her Houſe every night, tarried for me at the top of her little Stair-caſe. She told me ſhe was very ſorry ſhe cou'd not let me have my Room again, but wou'd give me another commodious enough, and that mine was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by a <hi>Seignora,</hi> the greateſt in <hi>Spain.</hi> Don <hi>Fernand</hi> askt her name, ſhe told him, ſhe was called Donna <hi>Eleonor</hi> of <hi>Toledo;</hi> he as ſoon inform'd me ſhe was his near Kinſwoman. He cou'd not comprehend by what chance ſhe ſhou'd come there.</p>
               <p>To be ſatisfied in the matter, he ſent his Gentleman to make her a Complement, and to know whether his viſit wou'd not be troubleſome. She ſent word ſhe had a great Satisfaction at this happy Meeting, and that he wou'd do her a great deal of honour. He went up immediately to her Chamber, and was inform'd by her of ſeveral particulars which related to him. He came afterwards to me, and told me very civilly, That where not Donna <hi>Eleonar</hi> exceſſive weary and indiſpoſed, ſhe wou'd have given me the firſt Viſit. I in ſhort, deſired him to conduct me to her Chamber, where ſhe receiv'd me in a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:151523:49"/> moſt obliging manner; and I obſerv'd in the firſt moment of our Converſation, that ſhe had a great deal of Wit and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I found her very neat and handſome, her Eyes were lively and ſo gliſtering, that one cou'd not without pain endure their brightneſs. Don <hi>Fernand</hi> told her who I was, and that I went to ſee one of my near Relations at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Her name was not unknow to her, no more than her Perſon, ſhe told me 'twas not long ſince the <hi>King</hi> had made her <hi>Titularia</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs</hi> of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> I ſhou'd be greatly obliged to you, Madam, <hi>ſaid I to her, interrupting her,</hi> if you wou'd be pleaſed to give me ſome Account of this title, ſhe having mention'd it in her Letters, without explaining to me what it means, no more than that of <hi>Grandee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take a pleaſure to inform you of what I know, <hi>replied</hi> Donna <hi>Eleonora,</hi> and I have always heard, that in the time of the firſt <hi>Kings, Doviedo, de Galicia</hi> and <hi>Aſturia,</hi> they were elected by the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Kingdom, and by the <hi>Ricos-homes.</hi> Theſe Lords having not yet obtain'd the Titles of <hi>Dukes, Marquiſſes</hi> and <hi>Counts,</hi> which diſtinguiſht them from <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> they were call'd <hi>Ricos-homes,</hi> which were as the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> now. The <hi>Ricos-homes,</hi> ſtood covered before the <hi>King,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred among the States, and had their <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> voice. And the <hi>Titulado</hi>'s at preſent, are the ſame which were then call'd <hi>Ricos-homes;</hi> but their Priviledges are not ſo large, and moſt of theſe Honours, as I ſhall tell you, have been reſerv'd to the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Titulado's</hi> may have a Canopy or Cloth of State in their Chamber, a Coach in <hi>Madrid</hi> with four Horſes, with <hi>los tiros largos,</hi> which are long Traces of Silk, which faſten the laſt Horſes to the foremoſt. When there are <hi>Bull-Feaſts,</hi> they have Balconies in the great place, where their Wives are regaled with Baskets full of Sweeetmeats, Gloves, Ribons, Fans, Silk-hofe, and this at the King or Towns charge, which gives the Feaſt. They have their Seat ſet out in the Ceremonies, and when the <hi>King</hi> makes a <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lado,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Caſtile, Arragon,</hi> or <hi>Grenada,</hi> he enters into the States of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Grandees,</hi> there are three different Ranks of them; and the manner in which the King ſpeaks to 'em in making them, diſtinguiſhes them. The one are thoſe whom he bids be <hi>covered,</hi> without adding any thing thereto; their Grandure is only fixt to their Perſon, and is not conſerv'd to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:151523:50"/>
               <p>The others, whom the <hi>King</hi> qualifies with the Title of one of their Lands; as for Example, <hi>Duke</hi> or <hi>Marquis</hi> of ſuch a place, <hi>Cover your ſelf, for you, and for yours,</hi> are <hi>Grandees</hi> in a more advantagious manner than the firſt, becauſe their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure being fixt to their Eſtates, paſſes to their eldeſt Son, and if they have none, to their Daughter or Heir.</p>
               <p>The laſt are not covered till after they have ſpoken to the King; and the difference between theſe is obſerv'd in ſaying, <hi>They are Grandees for Life, or in their Race.</hi> It is farther to be obſerv'd, That there are ſome whom the King makes be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before they ſpeak to him, in ſaying to 'em <hi>Cubridos;</hi> and they ſpake, and hear the King ſpeak, ever covered. Others, who are only covered after they have ſpoke to him, and he has anſwer'd them. And the third, who are only cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they have withdrawn themſelves from the King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wall; but when they be altogether in publick Offices, or at Chappel, there is no difference between them, they ſit down and are covered before him. And when he writes to them, he treats them as if they were <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> they have the Title of <hi>Excellency</hi> giv'n them. When their Wives go to the Queen, ſhe receives them ſtanding, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſitting on the Footcloth, they have Cuſhions brought 'em to ſit on.</p>
               <p>Here's Madam, <hi>continued Donna Eleonora,</hi> what you deſired to know; after due thanks for her Civility, the hour of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing being come, I took my leave of her, entreating her to continue me in her Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>I aroſe before day, becauſe we had a great Journey to make to lye at <hi>Aranda de Duero.</hi> The Weather growing milder, it became very miſty, which at length turned to Rain; and in arriving at Night, our Hoſt told us we were very welcome to him, but we muſt make a ſhift without Bread. This is, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I,</hi> a thing one cannot eaſily be without. And in effect, this News put me a little out of humour. I enquired how hapned this Scarcity; 'twas anſwer'd me, The <hi>Alcaid Major</hi> of the Town (who is he that orders every thing) and who is both <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> had ſent for all the Bread and Meal which was at the Bakers, and had brought it into his Houſe to make an equal Diſtribution of it, proportionable to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of each particular Perſon, and that what had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd this, was that the River of <hi>Duero,</hi> which paſſes about the Town, was frozen, and the Rivers of <hi>Leon, Suegra, Burgos, Tormes</hi> and <hi>Salamanca,</hi> which throw and loſe themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, had likewiſe ceaſed their Courſes, ſo that no Mills cou'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:151523:50"/> grind, which made 'em apprehend a Famine: This oblig'd us to addreſs our ſelves to him for to have the Bread we needed. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> ſent him one of his Gentlemen in the Name of us all, and immediately we had ſo much Bread ſent us, that we gave part to our Hoſt and his Family, who much wanted it.</p>
               <p>Scarce were we at Table, when one of my Servants brought into my Chamber ſeveral Packets of Letters, which they had found on the Stairs in the Inn. He that carried them having drank more than he needed, had fall'n there aſleep, by which means all his Letters lay expoſed to the Curioſity of all that paſt by. Here is in this Country a very ill order touching Commerce, and when the <hi>French</hi> Currier arrives at St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> all the Letters he brings are deliver'd to others who are good Footmen, and eaſe one another. They put theſe Packets into a Sack, tied with rotten Cords to their ſhoulders, by which means it oft happens, that the ſecrets of your Heart and Family are open to the firſt curious Body who makes drunk this Foot-poſt; and this is what hapned in this Occaſion; for Don <hi>Frederic de Cardonne</hi> having lookt on the Superſcriptions of ſeveral Letters, he at laſt met with one from a Lady in whom he was apparently intereſſed, at leaſt I ſo judg'd from the emotion of his Countenance, and the earneſtneſs with which he opened the Packet. He read the Letter, and was willing to ſhew it me without telling me from whom it came, nor for whom it was; but he promiſed to inform me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about it at <hi>Madrid;</hi> finding it well writ, it came into my mind, that you wou'd be perhaps glad to ſee the ſtyle of a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Lady,</hi> when ſhe writes to what ſhe loves. I prayed the <hi>Knight</hi> to let me take a Copy of it; but 'tis certain the Tranſlation takes away much of the beauty of the Original. Here it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>EVery thing contributes to afflict me in the unfortunate Embaſſy you have undertaken, not to mention that diſtance is the bane of the ſtrongeſt Friendſhip. I cannot flatter my ſelf, that a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the Sovereigns, may abridge the time of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and reſtore me a Good without which I can no longer live. Of all the Princes of</hi> Europe, <hi>he to whom you are ſent, is the moſt at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with us. I can foreſee no War with him, and this Scourge with which Heav'n puniſhes the guilty, wou'd be to me a thouſand times more welcome than Peace: Yes, I wou'd be glad to bear alone all the Diſaſters of it, to ſee my Lands waſted, my Houſes burnt, to loſe my Eſtate and my Liberty, provided we cou'd be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that without your ſhare in my Diſgraces, I cou'd enjoy
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:151523:51"/> the pleaſure of ſeeing you; you may judge by theſe Diſpoſitions of the Condition I am in, when I think that you are really going away, that I remain at</hi> Madrid, <hi>that I dare not follow you, that my Duty ſtiffes immediately the Projects I might make to comfort my ſelf, and that I loſe you, in fine, in a time wherein I have moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be perſwaded of yours, and wherein I feel more the Marks you gave me of it; I ſhou'd conceal from you my Grief, and add none to yours; but how can I weep and weep without you. Alas, Alas! I ſhall be ſoon forc'd to weep alone, are you not affraid ſo lively an Affliction will kill me, and can you not feign your ſelf ſick, that you may not leave me; think of all the Advantages which are included in this Propoſition; but I am a Fool to make it you, you will prefer the King's Orders before mine, and 'twou'd bring me into new Vexations to put you on ſuch a proof. Adieu, I ask you nothing, becauſe I have too much to ask you; I was never ſo afflicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I ended the Tranſlating this Letter which I ſend you, the <hi>Alcade</hi>'s Son came to ſee me; he was a young man who had a good Opinion of himſelf, and who was a true <hi>Guap.</hi> Let not this word offend you, <hi>(dear Coſin) Guap</hi> is the ſame in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as a brave Gallant and Spark is with us; his Hair was parted on the Crown of his Head, and tied behind with a blew Ribond about four fingers breadth, and about two yards long, which hung down at its full length; his Breeches were of black Velvet, button'd down on each Knee with five or ſix Buttons; he had a Veſt on ſo ſhort, that it ſcarce reacht below his Pockets, a Scollopt Doublet with hanging ſleeves about four fingers breadth, made of white embroidered Sattin. His Cloak was of black Bays, and he being a Spark, had wrapt it round his Arm, becauſe this is more gallant, with a very light Buckler in his hand, and which has ſtanding out in the midſt a ſteel Pike; they carried it with 'em when they walk in the Night on any Occaſion, he held in the other hand a Sword longer than an Half-pike, and the Iron for its Guard was enough to make a Breaſt and Back-plate. Theſe Swords being ſo long that they cannot be drawn out, unleſs a Man has the Arms of a Giant; the Sheaf therefore flies open in laying the finger on a little Spring. He had likewiſe a Dagger, whoſe Blade was very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, it was faſtned to his Belt on his back; he had ſuch a ſtrait Collar, that he cou'd neither ſtoop nor turn about his Head. Nothing can he more ridiculous than what they wear about their Necks, for it is neither a Ruff nor a Band, nor a Cravat. His Hat was a prodigious ſize, with a great Band twiſted about it, bigger than a mourning one. His Shoes were of as fine Leather as that whereof Gloves are made, and all ſlaſht and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151523:51"/> cut, notwithſtanding the cold, and ſo exactly cloſe to his Feet, that they ſeem'd rather paſted on, and having no Heels. He made me in entring a Reverence after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, his two Leggs croſs one another, and lowly ſtooping as Women do when they Salute one another; he was ſtrongly perfumed, and they are all ſo; his viſit was not long; he was very brisk; he forgat not to tell me he went oft to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that there were no Courſes of Bulls wherein he ventured not his life. But as the little care which was taken of Letters, run in my mind, and troubled me; I told him of the <hi>Courrier</hi> whom my People had found aſleep on the Stairs. He anſwer'd me, this hapned from the neglect of the great Poſt-maſter, or to ſpeak better, in that he wou'd gain too much, and that if the King knew of it, he wou'd not ſuffer it. This Name of <hi>Great Poſt-maſter</hi> made me enquire of him, whether any one rode Poſt in <hi>Spain.</hi> He told me, yes; provided they had the King's leave, or of the Great-Maſter, who is always a Perſon of a diſtinct Birth; and that unleſs you have an Order well ſigned, and in good form, you can have no Horſes. But, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> A Man who has fought a Duel, or has other Reaſons to haſten away; What does he? Nothing, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi> if he has good Horſes he makes uſe of them; and if he has not, he is perplext enough; but when one will go Poſt, and parts not directly from <hi>Madrid,</hi> it is ſufficient to take a Billet from the <hi>Alcade,</hi> which is to ſay, Governour of the Towns where you paſs. My Curioſity being ſatisfied on this Subject, the gallant <hi>Spaniard</hi> withdrew, and we ſupt altogether, as we were wont.</p>
               <p>I had been ſome time in Bed and aſleep, when I was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ringing of Bells, and by a confuſed Noiſe of dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Voices. I knew not as yet what was the Cauſe, when Don <hi>Fernand de Toledo,</hi> and Don <hi>Frederic de Cardonna,</hi> without knocking at my Door, burſt it open, and calling out to me, as loud as they cou'd to make me hear (for they had no Light) came both of them to my Bed, and throwing my Gown upon me, they carried me away, with my Daughter, as quick as they cou'd to the top of the Houſe. It is impoſſible to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you my aſtoniſhment and fear, I askt them at length, what was the matter? They told me the Thaw was come down all of a ſudden, with ſuch a great violence, that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, being ſwell'd by the Torrents which fell from all ſides of the Mountains, with which the Town is ſurrounded, had fall'n on it, and overflow'd it, that at the inſtant when they came to take me, the Water had already got to my Chamber, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:151523:52"/> that all was in horrid Confuſion, they needed ſay no more, for I heard dreadful Cries and Shrieks, and the Water ſhook the whole Houſe. I was never ſo ſeized with Fear in all my life; I affectionately regretted my dear Country! <hi>Alas!</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I have travell'd along way to come to drown my ſelf on the fourth Story of an Inn in</hi> Aranda. All Raillery apart, I thought ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly my laſt hour was come, and I was ſo troubled, that I was twenty times thinking to entreat theſe Gentlemen to hear me in Confeſſion. I believe that in the ſequel they wou'd have more laught at it than I. We were till Day in continual Alarms; but the <hi>Alcade,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the Town ſo ſpeedily and effectually beſtir'd themſelves in turning aſide the Torrents, and making the Waters paſs, that we were only affrighted; two of our Mules were drowned; my Litters and Cloaths were ſo ſoakt in Water, that to dry them, we were forc'd to tarry one whole Day; and this was no eaſie matter, for there are no Chimneys in the Inns, they heated the Oven, and put my Cloaths in it. I can aſſure you, I have not gained any thing in this unhappy Inundation: I lay down after this or to ſpeak better, I bathed my ſelf, my Bed being as wet as any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>My fellow Travellers thought fit to let me reſt a little; I have employ'd one part of my leiſure time in writing to you. Adieu dear Coſin; it is time to finiſh: I am ever, more yours than any Bodies in the World.</p>

               <p>THE Exactneſs I obſerve in giving you an Account of things which I judge worthy of your Curioſity, puts me often times on Enquiries into ſeveral Particulars which I ſhou'd have otherwiſe omitted, had you not perſwaded me that you are a great Lover of Novelties, and that you love to Travel without going out of your Cloſet.</p>
               <p>We parted from <hi>Aranda</hi> in a time of Thaw, which as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Air warmer, ſo it made the ways more troubleſome. We came a while after to the Mountain <hi>de Samozierra,</hi> which parts the <hi>Old Caſtile</hi> from the New; and we Traverſt it not without difficulty, as well for its height, as the quantity of Snow, with which the Bottoms were fill'd, and into which we ſometimes fell as from Precipices, believing the way even. They call this Paſs the <hi>Puerto,</hi> which Name methinks ſhou'd be only giv'n to a part, where one Embarks on the Sea, or a River; but it is thus, they call the Paſſage from one Kingdom to another, and you make your way to your Coſt, for the <hi>King's Officers</hi> wait for Travellers in the Road, and let 'em not go till they have paid what they require.</p>
               <p>In arriving at <hi>Buitrago,</hi> we were as wet as the night of the Inundation at <hi>Aranda,</hi> and tho' I kept my Litter, I felt no leſs the Incommodiouſneſs of the Weather than if I had been on foot or Horsback, becauſe the Litters are ſo ill cloſed and made in this Country, that when the Mules paſs through any Water, they throw up with their Feet part of the Water into the Litter, which there remains. So that I was forced in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, to change my Linnen and Cloaths: afterwards Don <hi>Fernand,</hi> the three Knights, my Daughter, and my Women, went with me to the Caſtle I had been ſo often told of.</p>
               <p>It appeared to me as regularly built as that of <hi>Lerma,</hi> not ſo large, but every whit as pleaſant: The Apartments are better contriv'd, and the Furniture is richer and very ſingular as well for its Antiquity as Magnificence. This Caſtle, as well as that of <hi>Lerma,</hi> belongs to Don <hi>Rodrigo de Silva de Mendoſa,</hi> Duke <hi>de Paſtrana</hi> and <hi>de L'infantada.</hi> His Mother's Name is Donna <hi>Katherina de Mendoſa &amp; Sandoval,</hi> Heireſs of the Dutchy's of <hi>Infantada</hi> and <hi>Lerma.</hi> It deſcends from Father to Son of <hi>Ruy Gomes de Silva,</hi> who was made Duke of <hi>Paſtrana,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Eboly</hi> by King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second. This Princeſs <hi>d'Eboly,</hi> who has been ſo much talkt of for her Beauty, was his Wife, and the King was paſſionately in love with her:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151523:53"/> They ſhew'd me her Picture; ſhe is repreſented at her whole length, ſitting under a Tent faſtned to ſome Boughs of Trees; ſhe ſeems as if ſhe were riſing, for ſhe has only a fine Linnen-cloth on her, which lets one part of her Body be ſeen. If ſhe were as handſome as her Picture makes her, and if her Features were ſo regular, ſhe muſt be judged the moſt charming Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the World; her Eyes are ſo lively and full of Spirit, that it ſeems as if ſhe was about ſpeaking to you; her Neck, Arms, Feet and Leggs are naked; her Hair falls down on her Breaſts, and little Cupids which appear every where about her, preſs on one another to ſerve her, ſome had her Slippers, others are ready to ſtrew flowers on her, and ſome hold her looking Glaſs. Others are ſeen farther off, who are ſharpning their Arrows, whilſt others fill their Quivers with them, and bend their Bow: A Fawn looks on her through Boughs, ſhe ſees him and ſhews him to a little Cupid, who is leaning on her Knees, and weeps as if he were afraid of it, at which ſhe ſeems to ſmile. I remained a great while looking on this Picture with the greateſt pleaſure; but I was made to paſs into a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, where I ſaw her again. She was painted in a large Piece attending Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second King of <hi>France</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain</hi> eſpouſed, inſtead of giving her to Don <hi>Carlos</hi> his Son, to whom ſhe had been promiſed. The Queen made her Entrance on Horſeback, as 'tis the Cuſtom, and I found the Princeſs <hi>Eboly</hi> leſs ſhining near her than ſhe appeared to me when alone. You may hereby judge of the Charms of this young Queen; ſhe had a blue Sattin Gown, but as to the reſt, juſt as I repreſented to you the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Lemos.</hi> The King ſtood in a Balcony to ſee her paſs by. He had a black Suit with a Collar of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> his Hair reddiſh and gray, long viſage, pale, old, wrinkled and ugly. The Infant Don <hi>Carlos</hi> accompanied the <hi>Queen,</hi> he was very white, a fine head, his Hair of a light yellow, his Eyes blue, and he lookt on the Queen with ſo moving an Air, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd the Painter knew the ſecret of his heart, and wou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it: His Habit was white, embroidered with precious Stones; he was in his Doublet, with his Hat botton'd upon one ſide, and covered with white Feathers. I ſaw in the ſame Gallery another piece which much affected me, which was the Prince Don <hi>Carlos</hi> dying, he was ſitting in a Chair, leaning on his Arm on a Table before him, holding a Pen in his Hand, as if he would have wrote ſomething; there was a Veſſel by him, wherein appeared a ſort of black Liquor, which appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently was deſign'd for Poyſon. A little further you ſee the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151523:53"/> Bath preparing for him, where his Veins were to be opened; the Painter had perfectly well repreſented the Confuſion of ſo ſad an Occaſion, and having read his Hiſtory, and being much affected with it, methoughts I ſaw him really dying. I was told theſe Pieces were of ineſtimable value. I was afterwards conducted into a Chamber, whoſe Furniture had belong'd to the Arch-Dutcheſs <hi>Marguerita</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Governeſs of the Low Countries; and it is pretended ſhe had workt it her ſelf, there is a neatly wrought Bed of Flowers, Woods, Animals, and Feathers of all Colours, the hangings are the ſame, and the different Colours therein do make a very agreeable ſhew. And this is what I found moſt remarkable in the Caſtle of <hi>Bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trago,</hi> and it growing late we left it.</p>
               <p>It was ſeveral days ſince I had the pleaſure of ſeeing the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Hombre,</hi> I therefore caus'd the Cards to be brought. Don <hi>Fernand,</hi> with two of the Knights, began the Game, and I intreſt my ſelf, as I was wont, and Don <hi>Eſtreve de Carjaval</hi> did the like; ſo that after we had ſeen them play ſome time, I demanded of him to whom of the three Knights was the <hi>Commanderſhip,</hi> whence they came when I met them. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd me, It did not belong to any one of them; that he had been to ſee one of their common Friends, on a vexatious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which had hapned to him in Hunting. Falling on the Subject of <hi>Commanderſhips,</hi> I intreated him to inform me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Orders of St. <hi>James, Calatrava,</hi> and <hi>Alcantara</hi> were ancient. He anſwer'd me, 'Twas above 500 years they had ſubſiſted; that heretofore the Order of <hi>Calatrava</hi> was call'd the <hi>Gallant,</hi> that of St. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Rich,</hi> and that of <hi>Alcantara</hi> the <hi>Noble.</hi> That which made 'em be call'd thus, was that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily there entred only young <hi>Cavaliers</hi> into <hi>Calatrava;</hi> that St. <hi>James</hi>'s was richer than the two others, and that to be receiv'd a Knight of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> one muſt make his Proofs of four Races, whereas to enter into the others, there needed only two. In the firſt times, when theſe Orders were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, the Knights made Vows, lived moſt regularly in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and wore Arms only to Combat the <hi>Moors;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the greateſt Lords of the Kingdom entred into it, who obtained the liberty to marry, under this Condition, that they ſhou'd be obliged to demand an expreſs Diſpenſation, from the Holy See, one muſt have the King's Letter, make his proofs of Nobility, and likewiſe prove he comes of <hi>old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which is to ſay, there have entred no <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Moors</hi> into his Fathers and Mothers Family. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eighth gave in 1489. to King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Succeſſors, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151523:54"/> of all the Commanderſhips of theſe three Orders, which are call'd <hi>Military.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> diſpoſes of them in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect under the Title of <hi>Perpetual Administrator;</hi> and he enjoys three great <hi>Maſterſhips,</hi> which bring him in above four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns a year. When he holds a Chapter, as Great Maſter of the Order, or any other Aſſembly, the Knights have the Priviledge to ſit and be covered in his Preſence. Don <hi>Eſteve</hi> added, That the Order of the <hi>Calatrava</hi> had 34 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manderſhips, and 8 Priories, valued at 120 thouſand Ducals a year; that <hi>Alcantara</hi> had 33 <hi>Commanderſhips,</hi> 4 <hi>Alcaydies;</hi> and 4 <hi>Priories,</hi> which yielded 80 thouſand Ducals, and that the 87 <hi>Commanderſhips</hi> of St. <hi>James,</hi> as well in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> as in the Kingdom of <hi>Leon,</hi> were valued at 272000 Ducats. You may hereby judge, Madam, <hi>continued he,</hi> that there are ſome helps for the poor Gentlemen of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I agree, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> that this would be very advantageous for them, were they the only Perſons admitted into theſe three Orders. But I think you now told me, that the greateſt Lords poſſeſs the beſt <hi>Commanderſhips.</hi> This is by a general Rule, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that <hi>thoſe who have much will have more,</hi> although there's the greateſt Juſtice others ſhou'd have a ſhare; and the eldeſt of great quality might have wherewith to ſatisfie them in obtaining the Order of the <hi>Fleece,</hi> which extreamly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes thoſe whom the King honours with it. However, this being a Favour accompanied with no Revenue, and being not eaſily obtained, few People ſeek it, and you ſee ordinarily none but <hi>Princes</hi> have it. If you know who inſtituted this Order of the <hi>Fleece, ſaid I to him,</hi> you will oblige me in informing me. It is pretended, <hi>replied he,</hi> that in the time when the <hi>Moors</hi> poſſeſt the beſt and greateſt part of <hi>Spain,</hi> a pious <hi>Peaſant,</hi> praying one day earneſtly to <hi>God</hi> to deliver the Kingdom from theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> perceived an <hi>Angel</hi> coming down from Heav'n who gave him a <hi>Fleece of Gold,</hi> and commanded him to make uſe of it to gather Troops, becauſe at this ſight he wou'd not be refus'd to be follow'd for the fighting the Enemy. This holy man obey'd; and ſeveral Gentlemen took up Arms in effect on what he told them.</p>
               <p>The Succeſs of this Enterprize anſwer'd the hope conceiv'd of it. So that <hi>Philip the Good,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> inſtituted the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> in the honour of <hi>God,</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> in the year 1429. and the Day of his Marriage with <hi>Iſabella</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was choſen for this Ceremony. It was made at <hi>Bruges,</hi> it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151523:54"/> that the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſhou'd be perpetual Chief of the Order, becauſe St. <hi>Andrew</hi> is Patron of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Thoſe who have it are call'd <hi>Cavallero's del Tuzon,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>Knights of the Fleece;</hi> and one may hence remark, that there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in relation to this Order, ſaying, when one ſpeaks of the others, That ſuch a one is Knight of the Order of St. <hi>James,</hi> or the Order of <hi>Calatrava.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time when we were thus talking, we heard a noiſe, as of a Coach and Attendants that ſtopt, not long after, Don <hi>Frederic de Cardona</hi>'s <hi>Valet de Cambre</hi> entred into my Chamber, to tell his Maſter, that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> was arriv'd.</p>
               <p>This is an unhappy Encounter for me, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> for I parted expreſly from <hi>Madrid</hi> to ſee him; and having not found him at <hi>Burgos,</hi> I was not a little troubled at it.</p>
               <p>Fortune is always on your ſide, <hi>ſaid Don</hi> Sancho <hi>ſmiling to him,</hi> but not to retard the pleaſure of ſeeing this Illuſtrious Kinſman, we will leave off our Game. Don <hi>Fernand</hi> and Don <hi>Sancho</hi> aroſe. Undoubtedly, <hi>ſays Don</hi> Eſteve, Don <hi>Frederic</hi> will not be of our Company this Night. I am of another mind, <hi>replied Don</hi> Fernand; the Archbiſhop is one of the moſt obliging Perſons in the World, aſſoon as ever he knows here's a <hi>French</hi> Lady, he will give her a Viſit. He will do me a great deal of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>anſwer'd, I</hi> but yet I ſhall be a little perplext, for we muſt ſup and go to reſt betimes. I had ſcarce ended theſe words, when Don <hi>Frederic</hi> return'd again.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever the Archbiſhop knew there was a ſtrange Lady at <hi>Buytrago, ſaid he to me,</hi> he no more minded me; and if you pleaſe, Madam, he will come and offer you whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on him in this Country.</p>
               <p>I anſwer'd this Civility as I ought; and Don <hi>Frederic</hi> being return'd to him, conducted him a while after into my Chamber. I found him extraordinary civil, he ſpake little, and obſerv'd the <hi>gravity</hi> befitting his Character, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation. He much bewailed my making ſo long a Journey in ſo rigorous a Seaſon, entreating me <hi>to lay my Commands on him in ſomething wherein he might obey me.</hi> This is the uſual Complement in this Country; he had a long Caſſock over his other Cloaths of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Velvet, with high ruffled Sleeves, which reacht to his very Ears, and a pair of Spectacles on his Noſe.</p>
               <p>He ſent for a little Monkey, which he wou'd needs give my Daughter; and though I was troubled at it, I cou'd not reſiſt his Inſtances, and the Deſires my Daughter had of accepting it. Every time the Archbiſhop took Tobacco, which he often did, this little Ape reacht out his Paw to him, and he put
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151523:55"/> ſome on it, which he made as if he wou'd take. This Prelate told me the King of <hi>Spain</hi> expected with extream impatience the Anſwer of the Marquis <hi>de Los-Balbares,</hi> on the Orders he had giv'n him on the Demand of <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> King. If his moſt Catholick Majeſty's Greatneſs be conſider'd, <hi>continued he,</hi> this Marriage muſt needs be eſteem'd very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; for when the Sun goes down in one part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, it riſes again in another. And this Monarch enjoys not alone his Grandure, he has the pleaſure of ſharing it to his Subjects, he is in a Condition to recompence them, to make them happy, to put them into high places, where their whole Ambition is ſatisfied, wherein they receive the ſame Honour as <hi>Soveraigns;</hi> and is not this what a <hi>King</hi> ought to wiſh, to be in a Capacity to recompence magnificently the Services which are rendred him, and force even an unthankful Perſon to become grateful. It is a ſurprizing thing, the number of Employs for Men of the Sword and the Gown, which his Majeſty every day beſtows.</p>
               <p>Several Perſons have ſpoken to me of this, as you do, my Lord, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> but I hope to be perfectly inſtructed in it at <hi>Madrid.</hi> I am able to inform you, at leaſt in part of what you wou'd know, <hi>replied he;</hi> ſome Reaſons have oblig'd me to take a little Abſtract, and which I think I have about me. He immediately delivered it to me; and having kept the Copy of it, and it appearing curious to me, I ſhall therefore hear, dear Couſin, tranſlate it for you.</p>

               <p>The Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Seville</hi> is worth 350 thouſand Ducats, and its Chapter above an hundred thouſand. Nothing can be ſeen finer than this Cathedral.

               <p>I ought not to omit obſerving, That the Cathedral of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi> is extraordinary ſtately; 'twas built by <hi>Abderhaman,</hi> who ruled over all the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> It ſerv'd them for a <hi>Moſque</hi> in the year 787. But the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> having taken <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua</hi> in 1236. they made a Church of this <hi>Moſque.</hi> It has 24 great Gates, all of 'em carv'd with Ornaments of Steel; its length is 600 foot, and 50 wide. It is perfectly well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd, and ſuſtained by 850 Pillars, the greateſt part of which are of <hi>Jaſper,</hi> and the others of <hi>black Marble,</hi> of one foot and an half Diametre.

I thank'd him, and told him, the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon obliged me to refuſe it, ſeeing without it he would make as bad a Supper as we.</p>
               <p>Yet Don <hi>Frederick de Cardona</hi> was already gone to fetch it and he returned laden with a great Silver Pot; but he was much ſurprized in finding it faſtned with a <hi>Lock:</hi> This is uſual in <hi>Spain;</hi> he would needs have the Key of the Cook (who taking
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151523:58"/> it ill that his Maſter would not eat his <hi>Olio</hi>) anſwered, he had unfortunately loſt the Key in the Snow, and knew not how to open it. <hi>Don Frederic</hi> vext at this, would againſt my will, go and acquaint the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> with it, who ordered his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Domo</hi> to look after it; he threatned the Cook, and the Scene paſt ſo near my Chamber, that I heard it all, but that which I liked beſt were the Cook's Anſwers, who ſaid, <hi>No puedo padecer la rina, ſiendo Chriſtiano viejo, hidalgo come el Key y poco mas,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>I cannot bear the being repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, who am of the Race of Old Christians, who are Noble as the King, and ſomething more.</hi>

               <head>LETTER. VII.</head>
               <p>WE can eaſily perceive that we are not far from <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Weather is fair notwithſtanding the Seaſon, and we have no more need of Fire; but it ſeems very ſtrange to us, that in the Inns which are the neareſt to this great Town, you are worſe uſed than in thoſe which are an hundred Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; you would think you came rather into <hi>Deſarts,</hi> than near a Town where reſides ſo great a <hi>Monarch;</hi> and I can aſſure you (dear Coſin) that in our whole Courſe, I have not met with an Houſe or Caſtle that has pleaſed me; I am much amazed at it, for I thought that in this Country as in ours, I ſhould find fine Walks, and curious Seats, whereas you can ſcarcely ſee any Trees, ſave ſome few which grow in ſpight of the Soil: And at this time, when I am but Ten Leagues from <hi>Madrid,</hi> my Chamber ſtands even with the Stable; it is an Hole that needs a Light at Noon, but what kind of Light think
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151523:59"/> you? better have none at all; for this is a Lamp which baniſhes all Chearfulneſs by its glimmering light, and your Health by its ſtinking ſcent: and go you where you will, tho' to the Curate of the Pariſh for a Candle, you will not find one, and I doubt much whether there be any in his <hi>Church.</hi> Here every where a ſad Scene of <hi>Poverty</hi> preſents it ſelf to your ſight; <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de Toledo,</hi> who took notice of my Aſtoniſhment, aſſured me I ſhould ſee very fine things at <hi>Madrid;</hi> but I could not forbear telling him, I could not eaſily imagine it: It is true, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bear up under their Indigency with ſuch an Air of Gravity as would cheat one, the very Peaſants telling their ſteps as they walk; they are mightily inquiſitive after News, as if their whole Being depended thereon; I have had many of 'em come into my Chamber without any Ceremony, and without Cloaths on their backs, or Shoes on their Feet, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to tell them what I knew of the Court of <hi>France;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had ſpoke to them, they have examined what I have ſaid, and argued on it among themſelves in ſuch a manner, as ſhewed great ſenſe, and a lively apprehenſion: This Nation has ever had ſomething extraordinary among them above others.</p>
               <p>There came to ſee me among others one of the Townſmen's Wives, a good likely Woman; ſhe carry'd her Child in her Arms, which was a dreadful lean one; he had above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred little hands like thoſe of Joynted Babies hanging about his Neck, and on all ſides of him. I askt his Mother what this meant? She anſwered me, this was good againſt <hi>Evil Eyes.</hi> How, ſaid I to her, do theſe little hands hinder one from any Diſtemper of the Eyes? Undoubtedly, replied ſhe, but not as you mean; for you muſt know if you pleaſe, there are Peo-in this Country, who have ſuch a <hi>Poyſon</hi> in their <hi>Eyes,</hi> that in looking ſteadfaſtly on a Perſon, and eſpecially on a young Child, they make him pine away to death. I ſaw a Man who had an <hi>Evil Eye,</hi> and doing miſchief when he lookt with this Eye, he was obliged to cover it with a great Plaiſter: As to the <hi>other Eye,</hi> it had no <hi>Malignity,</hi> yet it ſometimes hapned that being with his Friends, when he ſaw a great many <hi>Fowls</hi> together, he would ſay, chooſe which of theſe you would have me kill. He was ſhewed one, he took off his Plaiſter, lookt fixedly on the <hi>Fowl,</hi> and a while after ſhe turn'd ſeveral times round as giddy, and fell down dead. This Woman likewiſe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me there are <hi>Magicians,</hi> who looking on any one with an <hi>Evil</hi> intention, ſtrikes them with ſuch a Languiſhment, as makes 'em become lean like <hi>Skeletons;</hi> and her Child, ſhe told me, has been ſtruck in this manner, and the common Remedy
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151523:59"/> is theſe <hi>little hands.</hi> She moreover told me, it is the cuſtom, when they ſee any one look attentively upon them, and the Party has a look ill enough to fear ſhe ſhould give the <hi>Evil d' Ojos</hi> (it is thus called, becauſe it is done by the Eyes) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her own of theſe Hands, or even her own ſhut, and to ſay to her <hi>Toma la mano,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>Take this hand;</hi> to which the Party ſuſpected muſt anſwer, <hi>Dios le benediga, God bleſs you,</hi> which if ſhe does not, ſhe is judged to be ill intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereupon he or ſhe may be denunciated to the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or if you be the ſtronger, you may beat them till they ſay <hi>Dios le benediga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not aſſure you as a thing certain, that the Relation of the <hi>Fowls</hi> is poſitively true; but this is certain, that they are here ſtrongly perſwaded there are Perſons who can do you hurt by <hi>bare looking on you,</hi> and here are even <hi>Churches</hi> to which they go in <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to be cured of it. I askt this young Woman if there appeared nothing extraordinary in thoſe they call <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Eyes;</hi> She told me no; except that they are full of ſuch a ſhining Vivacity, that they ſeem to be all on fire, and would make one think they will pierce you like a Dart. She moreover told me, that of late the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> had cauſed an Old Woman to be ſeiz'd on, who was accuſed to be a <hi>Witch,</hi> and ſhe believed 'twas ſhe who had put her Child in that piteous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſaw it. I askt her what they would do to this Woman; ſhe told me if there were Proofs ſtrong enough, ſhe would be infallibly burnt, or left in the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and that the beſt treatment ſhe could chooſe would be to be delivered thence by being whipt along the Streets; That theſe Witches are tied to an Aſſes Tail, or that they are placed on theſe Beaſts coif'd with a Paper <hi>Mitre</hi> painted with all colours, with Writings which denote the Crimes they have committed: That in this fine Equipage they are led about the Town, where every one has the liberty to ſtrike them, or throw dirt at them. But, ſaid I to her, how know you their condition would be worſe if they remain'd ſtill in Priſon? O <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, I ſee you are not yet inform'd what the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is; whatever can be ſaid of it, comes not near the Rigours exerciſed therein: You are ſeiz'd on, and thrown into a Dungeon; you lye there two or three Months, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs, without a word being ſaid to you; at the end of this time you are led before the Judges, who with a terrible look ask you why you are there? It is Natural to anſwer, you know not. They ſay no more to you, but ſend you back again to this diſmal Hole, wherein is every day ſuffered a thouſand times more
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151523:60"/> trouble than Death it ſelf; yet you are not ſuffered to dye there, but remain many times a Year in this condition. At the end of this time, you are brought again before the ſame Judges, or before others, for they change, and go into ſeveral Countries; theſe demand of you again, why you are detained? You An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, you have been Apprehended, but you know not for what. You are ſent again into your Dungeon without any more words. In ſhort, ſometimes you paſs over your whole Life there. And demanding of her, if it were the Cuſtom for one to accuſe himſelf, ſhe anſwered, that as to ſome Perſons, 'twas the beſt and ſhorteſt way; but that the Judges held only this courſe with thoſe againſt whom they had no certain Proofs: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, when any one accuſes a Perſon of Capital Crimes, the Accuſer was wont to remain in Priſon with the Criminal, and this is the reaſon of their being a little more moderate. She related to me the particular puniſhments, and the whole manner of them, with which I will not fill this Letter, nothing being more dreadful. She moreover told me, ſhe knew a <hi>Jew</hi> named <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who was put into the Priſon of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Seville,</hi> with his Father, who was a <hi>Rabbin</hi> of their Law. It is four years ſince they were there, when <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> having made an hole, climb'd up to the top of a Tower, and making uſe of Ropes he had provided, he ſlid down along the Wall with a great deal of danger; but having got down, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd himſelf for having abandoned his Father, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering the Risk he ran after more than one manner, ſeeing his Father and he were condemned, and were to be led in a few days to <hi>Madrid</hi> with ſeveral others, to ſuffer there the greateſt Torment; yet this hindred him not from deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining himſelf, he generouſly climb'd up the Tower, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Dungeon, drew thence his Father, made him eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape before him, and got away himſelf. I found this Action very brave, and worthy to be ſet as an Example to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in an Age wherein, the moſt indiſpenſible Obligations are ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I continued entertaining my ſelf with this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when <hi>Conſtance,</hi> one of my Women, whom you know, came to tell me with great earneſtneſs, that ſhe now ſaw <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Daucourt,</hi> and that if I would, ſhe would ſtep out and call him: This is a Rich Gentleman, whom I knew at <hi>Paris,</hi> a civil Man, and of good Senſe, and of comely Perſonage: I knew he had a Brother at <hi>Madrid,</hi> belonging to <hi>Don Juan of Auſtria.</hi> Having ſhewed I ſhould be glad to ſpeak with him, <hi>Conſtance</hi> went out in queſt of him, and brought him to me. After the firſt Civilities, and informing my ſelf of the News
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151523:60"/> of my Kinſwomen whom I believed he knew, I askt him of his own Affairs, and whether he was content with his Journey. Ah, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſpeak to me no more of my Journey, cry'd he, there was never a more unfortunate; and had you come ſome days ſooner, you might have ſeen me hang'd. How, ſaid I to him, what do you mean by this? I mean, ſaid he to me, that I had all the fear of it, and that this is the moſt unpleaſant Country in the World for Strangers: But, Madam, if you are at leiſure, and would know more, I will relate to you my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is ſingular, and will fully prove to you what I have told you. You will do me a great deal of pleaſure, ſaid I to him, we are here in a place where ſuch a Relation will much divert us; he began it then in this manner.</p>
               <p>Some Affairs wherein I was concerned, and the deſire of ſeeing a Brother whom I had been away from ſome years, obliged me, Madam, to undertake this Journey to <hi>Madrid:</hi> I was little acquainted with the Cuſtoms of that place, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd one might go to Women without difficulty, and that one might play and eat with them; but I was aſtoniſh'd to learn, that every one of them is more retired in her Houſe, than a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> in his Cell; and that there are Perſons who have been mutually in Love for two or three years, and yet had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke to one another. Such ſingular Manners ſeem'd ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to me, I ſaid thereupon freely whatever came into my Head; but I treated the matter more ſeriouſly, when I underſtood theſe Women who were ſo cloſely confin'd, were the moſt amiable Women in the World; that they had ſuch a Delicacy, Vivacity, and Manners, as are no where to be met with but among them; that Love always appeared new, that no one would change a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman but for another. I was in the greateſt deſpair at the difficulties there were to get at them. One of my Friends, named <hi>Belleville,</hi> who was my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in my Journey, and who is a brisk Lad, was no leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on his ſide than I on mine: my Brother, who fear'd leſt ſome vexatious Accident ſhould befal us, continually inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into us how Jealous Husbands are in this Country; great Murtherers, and no more valued the killing of a Man than a Fly. This did not agree very well with two Men who were not as yet weary of living.</p>
               <p>We went into all parts where we thought we might ſee La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; we ſaw ſome in effect, but this did not ſatisfie us, all the bows and cringes we made 'em brought forth nothing; we each of us return'd home every Night very weary and diſguſted at our fruitleſs Circuits.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:151523:61"/>
               <p>One Night <hi>Belleville</hi> and I went upon Deſign to the <hi>Prado,</hi> which is a Walk adorn'd with great Trees, and ſeveral Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they throw their Water a great heighth, and in great guſhes it falls into Baſins, from whence it runs (when they have a mind) into the Courts to Water them, and ſo to make them freſh and pleaſant. It was the fineſt Weather this Evening that one could wiſh. After we had light out of our Coach, and ſent it away, we began to walk ſoftly, and having made a few turns, we ſat us down on the ſide of one of the Fountains, and then began to make our uſual Complaints. Dear <hi>Belleville,</hi> ſaid I to my Friend, ſhall we never be ſo happy to meet with one of theſe Witty and Charming <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women, ſo much boaſted of? Alas! ſays he, I deſire it too much, but dare not hope it: Hitherto we have met with nothing but ſuch ugly Creatures, as run after Folks to fright them, and who under their white Vails are more Tauny and Loathſom than the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> ſuch as theſe, I ſwear to you, do not pleaſe me at all, and notwithſtanding their ſprightfulneſs, I cannot conſent to enter into a very near converſation with them.</p>
               <p>At the very inſtant theſe words were out of his Mouth, we ſpy'd coming out of a Door hard by, two Women; they had left off their upper Garments, which were always very plain; and when they open'd their Manta's, the light of the Moon made the glory of their Gold and Precious Stones appear. As God's true, cries out <hi>Belleville,</hi> here's at leaſt two Fairies. Nay, ſaid I, let's be juſter, and think them not other than two Angels. When they came near us, we ſtood up, and made them the loweſt Bow that ever we did in our lives. They paſt by us ſoftly, and with thoſe little Apiſh Tricks, which become the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo well, they lookt at us, firſt with one Eye, and then with t'other. They went on a little; we were in pain what to think, whether they would return back the ſame way, or whether we ſhould follow them; but while we were deliberating, we perceiv'd them to approach us; when they were near us, they ſtood ſtill, one of them began to ſpeak, and askt us, if we could ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> I ſee by your Habits, ſaid ſhe, that you are ſtrangers. But pray tell me of what Country are you? We told her we were <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and that we ſpoke <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ill enough, but we had a great mind to learn to ſpeak it well: That to ſucceed therein, we were perſwaded we muſt love a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman, and we heartily wiſh'd we might find one that deſir'd to be belov'd. The matter is nice, reply'd the other Lady, which had not yet ſpoke, and I ſhould be ſorry for her who engages in ſuch a Deſign,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151523:61"/> for I have heard that <hi>Frenchmen</hi> are not Faithful. Oh! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays <hi>Belleville,</hi> this was ſome body which had a mind to do us an ill turn, and put us out of your good opinion, but it will be eaſie to wipe off this Aſperſion. Though I may ſoon give my Heart to a pretty Woman, yet I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I cannot ſo eaſily call it back again. What! ſays ſhe that ſpoke to me before, dare you without further conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enter into ſuch an Engagement at firſt ſight? I ſhould not have quite ſo good an Opinion of you. Oh! Madam, cries he, why ſhould we loſe precious Time? If it is good to love at all, it is good to begin as ſoon as 'tis poſſible: Hearts that are born to Love, languiſh and decay when they are not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed therein. Your Maxims are fine, reply'd ſhe, but they ſeem dangerous; it is not only neceſſary to avoid following of them, but even the hearing of them; and then indeed they would have been gone, but we beg'd them with great earneſtneſs to tarry a few moments longer in the <hi>Prado.</hi> We ſaid all the pretty things to them both, which might oblige them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves, and give us the ſatisfaction of ſeeing them without their Vails. Our Converſation was very brisk, and pleaſant enough: they had abundance of Wit; and as they knew how to manage all their Advantages, ſo without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhew'd us their Hands as they had occaſion to mend the ſitting of their Head-dreſſes, and they were whiter than the Snow. In ſpight of their ſeeming care to hide themſelves, yet we ſaw enough to obſerve their delicate Complexion, their brisk Eyes, and their Features very regular. You may be ſure we left them as late as we could, and that we conjur'd them to make that Walk happy ſometimes with their Preſence, or elſe give us leave to wait on them at their Houſe. They agreed to nothing; and indeed, we were ſeveral times after that at the <hi>Prado,</hi> and near that Fountain where the firſt ſaw them, without being able to perceive them. Here's a deal of time loſt, ſaid we; what muſt we do to paſs our Lives in this great want of Employment, for we muſt renounce the thoughts of Ladies, whoſe Acceſs is ſo difficult? This was our Reſolution, but it held not long, for ſcarcely had we made it, but we ſee come out of the ſame Houſe the two <hi>Incognito's.</hi> We drew near them, full of Reſpect, and our civil Carriage did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them. <hi>Belleville</hi> took the leaſt by the hand, and I the biggeſt. I endeavour'd to perſwade her with what Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I expected her. I blam'd her a little, at which ſhe ſeem'd ſomewhat concern'd; but taking more courage, I diſcours'd to her of the thoughts ſhe had inſpir'd me with, and aſſur'd
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:151523:62"/> her, that it was in her power to engage me for my whole Life. She ſeem'd extream careful not to give the leaſt mark of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. At length, amongſt other things, ſhe told me, that ſhe was Heireſs to a great Eſtate; that her Name was <hi>Ines,</hi> that her Father was a Knight of the Order of St. <hi>James,</hi> and was of a conſiderable Quality; that ſhe, which was with her, was called <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and that they were Coſins. All theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars pleas'd me well, finding her a Perſon of Birth and therein my Vanity flatter'd. At parting, I begg'd her to give me leave to come ſee her, What you deſire of me, ſays ſhe, is the Cuſtom of your Country; and if I were there, I would pleaſe my ſelf to obſerve it; but we have different, and tho' I do not conceive any Crime in what you ask me, yet I am oblig'd to obſerve certain Rules of Decency, which by no means I will tranſgreſs. I will contrive ſome other way to ſee you, and of this, depend upon me, and do not take it ill, that I refuſe you a thing, which is not in my power to grant. Adieu, continues ſhe, I will think of what you deſire, and will let you know what I can do. I kiſt her Hand, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, extreamly touch'd with her way, as well as her Wit and her Prudence.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I was alone with <hi>Belleville,</hi> I askt him, if he was pleas'd with the Converſation he had enjoy'd. He anſwer'd me, that he had great cauſe to be ſo, and that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſeem'd to be of a Nature ſweet and amiable. You are very happy, ſaid I, already to have found ſo much kindneſs. <hi>Ines</hi> gives me no room to hope for any. She's of a gay Humour, and turns every thing I ſay to her into Jeſt, and I deſpair ever to make her ſerious. Some days paſt, before we either ſaw or heard from them: But one Morning as I was at Maſs, an Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hid under a Vail, comes up to me, and preſents me a Billet, in which I read theſe words:
<q>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> appear too Amiable to me to ſee you often, and I muſt needs confeſs to you, that I a little miſtruſt my own Heart: If yours is truly touch'd for me, Marriage muſt be thought on. I have told you that I am Rich, and I have told you the truth: That part which I offer you, is not inconvenient to take: But conſider of it, and in the Evening I ſhall be on the Banks of <hi>Manſanarez,</hi> where you may let me know your thoughts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the place where I was did not allow me to write her an Anſwer, ſo I contented my ſelf to Note only on my Table-Book theſe Lines:
<q>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:151523:62"/>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> have power to make me take what Journey you pleaſe. I am very ſenſible, that I Love you too well to be at eaſe, and that I have more cauſe to ſuſpect my own Weakneſs, than you have to be afraid of yours; however, I ſhall be at <hi>Manſanarez,</hi> being reſolv'd to obey you, whatever you Command me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I gave my Table-Book to this honeſt Meſſenger, which had the looks tho', to ſteal off the Plates and Claſps before ſhe would deliver it. I deſir'd <hi>Belleville</hi> to let me go alone to this Aſſignation. He told me, he was very glad of it, for <hi>Iſabella</hi> had given him Notice, that ſhe deſir'd to ſpeak with him alone at the <hi>Florid.</hi> It was with impatience that we waited for the appointed hour, and then we quitted each other, after having wiſh'd our ſelves good Succeſs in our Adventure.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I came to the River-ſide, I carefully lookt at all the Coaches which paſt by; but it was hard for me to diſcover any thing, becauſe they had double Curtains drawn. But at laſt, there came one and ſtopt, and I perceiv'd ſome Women in't, who gave me a ſign to approach. There was <hi>Ines,</hi> who was more conceal'd than uſual, and I could not know her but by her Voice. How induſtriouſly you hide your ſelf, ſaid I to her. Do you think, Madam, that the thoughts of not being able to ſee you, and the violent deſires I have for it, are not enough to kill me with Grief? If you'l come along with me, ſays ſhe, you ſhall ſee me. But for the preſent I muſt hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink you. To be free with you, ſaid I to her, till now, you have appear'd very amiable to me; but this Myſterious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which ſerves to no end, but to make me ſuffer, is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. If I am ſo unhappy to be thought by you an unfaithful man, you ought not at all to truſt me; but if on the contrary, I am in your good Opinion, you ought to declare it, by a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ingenuous proceeding. Interrupting me, ſays ſhe, you ought to be perſwaded, that I have ſtrong Reaſons for what I do, ſince notwithſtanding what you have now told me, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not my Reſolution. The thing however is at your choice; but for my own part, I will not let you come into my Coach, but upon that Condition. As the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are naturally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, I rather choſe to ſuffer my Eyes to be cover'd than to break off with her. I muſt needs own, that theſe appearances of Good Fortune, had fill'd me with ſome ſort of Vanity, and I fancy'd my ſelf with ſome Princeſs, which for the preſent had no mind I ſhould know her, but afterwards, that I ſhould find her, one of the moſt perfect and rich Women of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:151523:63"/> This conceit hinder'd me any longer to oppoſe her will. I told her, I ſubmitted to her, to be hood-wink'd, and even to be blinded by her, if ſhe could pleaſe her ſelf in the Action. She ty'd a Handkerchief about my Head ſo hard, that at firſt ſhe put me in terrible pain: I ſat me down by her; it was now dark, I knew not whether we were going, but I gave my ſelf up entirely into her power.</p>
               <p>She had with her two other Women; the Coach mov'd ſo long, that I believe we paſs'd through moſt of the ſtreets of <hi>Madrid.</hi> She entertain'd me with ſuch witty Diſcourſe, that I had no need to think the time or way long; and I was even charm'd with hearing her, when our unlucky Coach, which was but a mean one, run upon another and all on a ſudden was over-turn'd. And we happen'd to fall in a place call'd the <hi>Marèe,</hi> which is one of the greateſt and naſtieſt Ditches in the City. I was never ſo vex'd in my life; the three Ladies fell upon me, they almoſt ſtifled me, and I was even deaf with their noiſe. Having my Eyes bound, and my Head turn'd about after a ſtrange faſhion, I could not have my ſhare of making a noiſe, without ſwallowing a great deal of this ſtinking Water. I then began to make ſome Reflections on the unlucky hours of a Man's Life; and though I dearly lov'd <hi>Ines,</hi> yet I found that I lov'd my ſelf more, and wiſh'd I had never ſeen her. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſitively tell how things paſt, but I felt my ſelf deliver'd from that heavy weight which ſo oppreſs'd me; and when, by the help of ſome People which drew me out, I got upon my leggs, I could neither ſee <hi>Ines</hi> nor her Companions. The Folks which ſtood about me, laugh'd like ſo many Fools, to ſee me hood-wink'd, and ſo cover'd with this black Water, that I look'd as if I had come out of an Ink-tub. I askt the Coach-man where his Miſtreſs was. He told me the Lady with whom I was, was none of his Miſtreſs, and that ſhe went away curſing of me; that ſhe was very dirty; that he knew her not; and that ſhe only ſaid to him at going away, that I muſt pay him. And prethee, ſaid I, where didſt thou take her up? He anſwer'd me, At the Gate <hi>Delcalcas Reales,</hi> and that an Old Woman came for him, and brought him to that place where he took her up. For my Money I got him to carry me home. I expected <hi>Belleville</hi> with a mixture of Impatience and Grief: It was late before he came, and he was extreamly ſatisfied with <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in whom he found abundance of good Nature, and an infinite deal of Wit.</p>
               <p>I related to him my Adventure, he could not but laugh heartily at it; and as he was fill'd with an extraordinary Joy, ſo he told me a hundred pleaſant Stories, which put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151523:63"/> into a very bad Humour: It was day-light before we went to Bed, and I had not got up, but to take a walk with him in the <hi>Prado;</hi> As we were going along by ſome very low Windows, I heard <hi>Ines</hi> cry out to me, <hi>Cavallero,</hi> go not ſo faſt, it is at leaſt fit to ask you how you do after your fall laſt Night. Advancing to the Window, pray, ſaid I to her, what became of you, fair <hi>Ines?</hi> And had not I misfortunes enough, but I muſt loſe you too. You had not loſt me, reply'd ſhe, but that a Lady, who was my Relation, paſſing by in that moment, knew my voice, and I was oblig'd againſt my mind, to go with her in her Coach, for I was unwilling ſhe ſhould ſee us together; though the Coach-man told me another ſtory, yet I durſt not examine any further into the matter, for fear of making her uneaſie, and with abundance of kindneſs I askt her, when I ſhould have an Opportunity without any reſtraint to let her know what a mighty Paſſion and Reſpect I had for her. It ſhall be very quickly, ſays ſhe, for I now begin to think you love me; but yet time muſt confirm me in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Oh! you are very cruel, ſaid I, and muſt have very little Love for me, thus to defer what I ſo earneſtly beg. Speak the truth freely, ſays ſhe, and tell me whether you will Marry me? Yes, ſaid I, if you will, I'll Marry you, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I never yet had a full ſight of you, nor have had the happineſs to know you. I am Rich, ſays ſhe, and am of Birth, and they tell me, I have ſome Perſonal Merits. I reply'd, You have all the things which pleaſe me, beyond any Perſon in the World: Your Wit hath charm'd me, but you make me often deſpair, and I had much rather chooſe to dye at once, than ſuffer what I do. She fell a laughing, and after that, there were few Evenings that we did not converſe together, either at the <hi>Prado,</hi> or at <hi>Manſanarez,</hi> or elſe at ſome Houſe unknown to me, whither I was conducted. I muſt confeſs, I never went into the Chamber with her, and I only talkt to her through the Grates of the Window, where for four hours together I uſed to make the moſt impertinent Figure in the World. To ſpeak freely, one muſt live in <hi>Spain,</hi> to be able to endure ſuch ways and Cuſtoms; but yet really I lov'd <hi>Ines;</hi> I obſerv'd in her ſomething that was very ſmart and taking, which ſurpriz'd and affected me.</p>
               <p>One time I met her in a Garden, where ſhe had appointed me to be, and where ſhe ſhew'd me more kindneſs than ſhe us'd to do. When ſhe ſaw it begin to be dark, ſhe deſir'd me to be gone; I unwillingly obey'd her, and as I went along a narrow Street, I perceiv'd three Men with Sword in hand, ſet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:151523:64"/> upon one ſingle Man, who defended himſelf valiantly: I could not endure to ſee ſo unequal a Match, and I run to Second him, but juſt as I came up to him, they made a paſs at him, and he fell upon me like a dead Man. Theſe Murderers run away as faſt as they could, and by this time the noiſe had drawn out a great many People, who ſeeing me with my Sword in hand, made no queſtion that I was one of the Criminals. They prepar'd to ſeize me, but perceiving their ill intentions, I thought it was better to provide for my ſafety by flight, than to truſt to my Innocence. I was cloſely purſu'd, and which way ſoever I took, ſtill they met with me. In this diſtreſs, I had a glympſe of a Door half open, I ſlipt into it without any body's ſeeing me, and groping along, I came at laſt into a very dark Hall; I perceiv'd Light through a door, I could not tell whether it was beſt to open it, nor what I ſhould ſay, if there were People in it. I conſider'd with my ſelf, that I had the looks of one affrighted, and that I ſhould be taken for a Man that came from doing ſome ill Action, and ſought for an Opportunity to do ſome other: I delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a long time, I liſten'd with great Attention to hear ſome body talk, and hearing none, at laſt I ventur'd, and ſoftly open'd the Door, and ſaw no body; I nimbly look'd about where to hide my ſelf; methought the Hangings ſtuck out in ſome places, and really I got behind them in a little corner: I had been there but a very little while, when I eſpy'd coming in, <hi>Ines</hi> and <hi>Iſabella.</hi> I cannot expreſs to you, Madam, what a pleaſant Amazement I was in, to find my ſelf in my Miſtreſs's Houſe: I no ways doubted, that Fortune favour'd my Deſign; I was in no fear of thoſe who might ſearch after me, and as I was even ready to go and throw my ſelf down at her feet, I heard <hi>Iſabella</hi> begin to Diſcourſe. Says ſhe, What haſt thou been doing to day, dear <hi>Ines,</hi> Haſt thou ſeen <hi>Daucourt?</hi> Yes, ſays <hi>Ines,</hi> I have ſeen him, and I have reaſon to believe he loves me deſperately, unleſs all my Rules deceive me; he talks very ſeriouſly of Marrying me; that which perplexes me, is, that he will firſt ſee and know me. And how is it poſſible for thee to deny either the one or the other? replies <hi>Iſabella.</hi> No, I do not pretend to do it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Ines,</hi> only I'll take the moſt favourable Opportunities; I fancy I ſhall not think it cunning to ſet my ſelf in a full light, and all the Curtains open; no, I intend they ſhall be cloſe drawn, and that the Windows ſhall only let in ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rays of the Sun, which ſhall ſerve to ſet me off. As to my Birth, I have got my Pedigree Authentically drawn, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151523:64"/> coſt me nothing but a little Old Parchment gnaw'd by the Mice. And as to ready Money, thou knoweſt my Old Lover, honeſt <hi>Don Diego,</hi> will furniſh me: when <hi>Daucourt</hi> has told and receiv'd it, he will little think, that Thieves are appointed to take it away from him upon our very Wedding-Night: I have this day taken very fair Lodgings ready Furniſh'd; ſo that thou wilt yield, I have neglected nothing which might contribute to the ſucceſs of a buſineſs ſo advantagious to me, and which I ſo much deſire. Says <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Thy precautions ſeem very wiſe; but yet I fear the diſcovery of the Intrigue. But ſays <hi>Ines,</hi> Prethee my Dear, what doſt thou do? As to Marriage, I make but a ſmall Progreſs, ſays <hi>Iſabella;</hi> but to ſpeak truth, that is not my Deſign: I find <hi>Belleville</hi> an honeſt Man; I am ſenſible that I love him, I only deſire the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Heart, and I fancy, I ſhould be ſorry if he would Marry me. Thou art of an odd ſort of Humour, ſays <hi>Ines;</hi> thou loveſt him, thy Fortune is none of the greateſt, thou might'ſt be happy with him, and yet thou durſt not deſire to be his Wife. But prethee, ſays <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who told thee that I ſhould be happy with him? Love is ſo unconſtant a thing, that hardly are the firſt moments of Marriage pleaſant; I tell thee, Love muſt have ſomething continually to provoke and ſpur it; Novelty is a grateful Diſh to it, and how is it poſſible for a Wife always to be new? And how can a Miſtreſs either, cries <hi>Ines,</hi> be ſo? Go, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> thy Modiſh Maxims are not reaſonable. Neither, ſays <hi>Iſabella,</hi> can I like of what thou deſigneſt; and if thou would'ſt take my Advice, thou ſhould'ſt ſeriouſly conſider thine own Age; for to ſpeak freely, thou art Old, very Old: Is it juſt for ſixty Years to put the Cheat upon a Man of thirty? He will be enrag'd at thee, he will certainly forſake thee, or elſe he'll break thy Bones; nay, it may happen he'll knock thy Brains out before he leaves thee. <hi>Ines</hi> was of a quick Apprehenſion and brisk; ſhe took it hainouſly that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould reproach her with her Age, and immediately ſhe gave her the greateſt box on the Ear which perhaps was ever given. The other, of as haſty a Nature, return'd her two. <hi>Ines</hi> lent her a dozen good cuffs with her fiſt, which were ſpeedily repaid: So that my two Female Champions entred the Field of <hi>Mars.</hi> The Combat was ſo extream pleaſant between them, that I almoſt broke my ſides with laughing in my little Hole, and I had much ado to hinder my ſelf from breaking out aloud; for you may eaſily believe, Madam, that I had very little concern for either of them, after the Trick which I underſtood was to be put upon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151523:65"/> me with ſo much Malice, and when I muſt neceſſarily look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ines</hi> as a common Jilt. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who knew all the weak places of her Enemy, took her Opportunities, and being both younger and ſtronger, tore off her Head-dreſs, and left her all bald. In my whole Life I was never more ſurpriz'd, than to ſee the Hair fall off, which before appear'd ſo lovely to me, and which I thought had been her own: But this was nothing to what follow'd, for with one blow of her fiſt ſhe not only made ſeveral of her Teeth leap out of her Mouth, but alſo two little Cork-plumpers, which ſerv'd to fill out her hollow Jaws. And here the Fray ended, for their Chamber-Maids, who had heard the noiſe of the Skirmiſh, run in, and with much ado parted them. They ſaid the bittereſt things one againſt the other, and even threatned to reveal to the Inquiſition moſt terrible Crimes, with which they reproach'd each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ines</hi> finding her ſelf with her Chamber-maid only, look'd at her ſelf a long time in a great Glaſs, and proteſted that there was nothing ſo injurious, which ſhe had not ſaid to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that ſhe might be reveng'd of her for the Abuſes ſhe had receiv'd from her: At laſt ſhe ſat her down and reſted her ſelf a while; a little Table was brought and ſet before her, and upon it ſhe lays an Artificial Eye, which uſed to fill up the place of a Natural one ſhe wanted; afterwards, ſhe takes off her Face as much white and red Colour, as without any Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole, would have covered a Mask. It would be hard to deſcribe to you, Madam, the extraordinary uglineſs of this Woman, who till now, had appear'd to me very pretty. I rub'd my Eyes, I was like a Man that could not tell whether he doted, or had ſome idle Dream. To be ſhort, ſhe undreſt her ſelf, and was almoſt naked: and here I ſhall forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to you this frightful Carcaſs. But certainly, Love never met with a better Cure; in all thoſe parts where other Folks are fat and plump, ſhe was lean and hollow; ſhe lookt perfectly like a Skeleton, which by ſome ſecret Spring was made to move about the Room: She was in a Gown with a white Mantle upon her ſhoulders, her Head bald, and her Arms appear'd extream little and lean; ſhe bethought her ſelf, that in the Scuffle her Pearl Bracelets broke, ſhe had a mind to gather them up, but had enough to do to find them; her Chamber-maid came to help her, they counted them, and found they had all but two, which were well curs'd for my ſake: <hi>Ines</hi> ſwore by St. <hi>James,</hi> Patron of <hi>Spain,</hi> that ſhe would not go to Bed till ſhe had found them: Her Maid and ſhe lookt in every corner and hole, removing the Tables,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151523:65"/> tumbling the Chairs, and throwing this way and that way eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they came near, for <hi>Ines</hi> was in a very ill Humour: As I ſaw her make towards my corner, fear of being diſcovered by ſuch a Fury, made me lye as cloſe as 'twas poſſible; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily as I drew back, I threw down ſeveral Bottles which ſtood there upon Shelves, and theſe made a mighty noiſe: <hi>Ines</hi> believing it was the Cat which had done this miſchief, with all her might cry'd out, <hi>Gato, Gato;</hi> that is, Cat, Cat; and lifting up the Hangings to chaſtiſe the Cat, with an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rage which almoſt ſtruck her dead upon the ſpot, ſhe eſpy'd me; ſhe fell violently upon me, and pull'd the Hair off my Head; ſhe revil'd me grievouſly, ſhe was like one Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the veins of her Neck were ſo ſwell'd, and her wrinkles and furrows were ſo frightful, that methought I ſaw the Head of <hi>Meduſa;</hi> and in this my great Terror, I conſidered my eſcape, when on a ſudden I heard a ſtrange noiſe upon the Stairs, which gave me a freſh Alarm: But <hi>Ines</hi> left me, and run down to know what was the matter, and by that time, the whole Houſe was fill'd with cries and weeping: The Officers of Juſtice, who had found this Young Man (of whom I told you before, Madam) lying upon the Ground, and was the cauſe I was ſo hotly purſu'd, after ſome diligent ſearch, found that he was the Son of a Lady who liv'd in the ſame Houſe; they brought him thus with his Body all wounded and bloody, at which ſad ſight ſhe fell into a deſperate condition. And as I had told <hi>Ines</hi> ſomething of my Adventure, that I might give her ſome ſatisfaction why I came into her Chamber, ſo this lean Hag, would not keep my Secret, but to be reveng'd on me for having diſcover'd her crafty tricks, was reſolv'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt me. I have the Murderer in my power, cries ſhe; come, come along with me, and I'll deliver him up to you. Immediately ſhe opens her Chamber-door, and being follow'd by a Troop of <hi>Alquazils,</hi> that is to ſay, Serjeants or Bayliffs, deliver'd me up to them with all the neceſſary Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for my ſpeedy Tryal. Says ſhe, I ſaw this wretch with his naked Sword all bloody with the wound he came from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he ran into my Chamber to ſave himſelf, and threatned me with Death if I would not conceal him. Whatever I could ſay in my Juſtification was all in vain, they would not ſo much as hear me; they bound my hands with Cords, and ſo led me to Priſon as a wretched Malefactor, whilſt good <hi>Ines,</hi> and the Mother and Siſter of the wounded, loaded me with blows and curſes; they cauſed me to be put in a Hole, where I was ſeveral days without having the liberty to give notice to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151523:66"/> my Brother or my Friends of what had paſt; they likewiſe were in mighty pain about me, concluding for certain, that I was murder'd in ſome corner of a Street, or elſe at ſome of my Night-Intrigues.</p>
               <p>At laſt, <hi>Belleville,</hi> who ſtill continu'd to ſee <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with his grief, and beg'd her to aſſiſt him to diſcover at leaſt, what they had done with my Body: She was ſo induſtrious to get Information about it, that <hi>Ines</hi>'s Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, who had been ill enough us'd by her Miſtreſs, told her the whole Secret of the Hiſtory, altho' her good Lady had ſtrictly forbid her. Upon this News, my Brother ran to beg the King to have pity on me, and to command them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move me out of that hole, which ſeem'd more like Hell than a Priſon: I ſwooned away when I ſaw light: I was ſo waſted and weak, that I frighted folks; but yet I could not come out of Priſon for ſome time, becauſe of certain Formalities; and I leave you to think, Madam, what I mediated againſt the perfidious <hi>Ines;</hi> but yet I know not whether ever I ſhould be in a condition to put in execution all the Projects of my juſt Revenge, for the Gentleman, who was wounded, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tued very ill, and his Life was deſpair'd of; mine depended upon ſuch a tickliſh point, that I put up moſt ardent Prayers for him; and in ſuch a melancholy uncertainty, I paſt a great many hours: But my Brother, who was perſwaded of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, omitted nothing for the diſcovery of the Authors of this Murderous Act. At laſt, he underſtood, that this young and wounded <hi>Cavallero</hi> had a Rival, and he made ſo diligent a Search and Examination, that he certainly knew that the Blow came from thence; he was ſo fortunate to get him apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this Man freely own'd the Fact, which acquitted me. I was therefore ſet at Liberty, and I conceiv'd ſo much Joy at it, that I was ſick for ſeveral days after; or rather perhaps, it was an effect of that unwholſom Air which I receiv'd in the Priſon.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, wicked <hi>Ines,</hi> who to be ſure, was not much at eaſe, for fear of what might happen upon her ſerving me ſuch a pleaſant Trick, having notice that I was ſet free, and in a condition to Reward her according to her Merits, pack'd up her Baggage, and one Night privately runs away, and no body knew whither ſhe was gone; ſo that when we wanted her, at leaſt to make her an Example amongſt the cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jilts,</hi> we were diſappointed. But I was eaſily ſatisfy'd, becauſe naturally I do not love to do any hurt to Women. But leſt ſhe might play me ſome other pranks, I left <hi>Madrid,</hi> that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151523:66"/> I might alſo avoid thoſe of <hi>Spain.</hi> I am now returning into <hi>France,</hi> Madam, continued he, whither I ſhall be very glad to carry your Commands, if you'll do me ſo great an Honour to lay any upon me.</p>
               <p>Though I have ſome trouble at what happened to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, yet I could not chuſe but laugh at ſome Circumſtances of this Adventure, and I am willing to believe, Dear Coſin, that you will not be diſpleas'd, that I make you partake with me. I ſhall write to you no more till I come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where I promiſe my ſelf to ſee things far more worthy of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, than hitherto I have been able to acquaint you.</p>

               <p>I Would not, if you pleaſe, Dear Coſin, have you angry, that I did not write to you as ſoon as I arriv'd at <hi>Madrid:</hi> I thought it was better to tarry till I was in a condition to tell you ſomething more exactly and curious. I knew that my Kinſwoman was to go before me, as far as <hi>Alcouendas,</hi> which is about ſix Leagues diſtance from <hi>Madrid.</hi> As ſhe was not yet come, and I had a mind to ſtay for her, <hi>Don Frederic de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne</hi> propos'd to me to go Dine at a very fine Houſe, the Maſter whereof was his particular Acquaintance: So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going into this little Village, we croſs'd by it, and through a Walk pleaſant enough, we came to the Houſe of <hi>Don Auguſtin Pacheco.</hi> This Gentleman is ancient, and yet he is lately marry'd to <hi>Donna Thoreſa de Figucroa:</hi> This is his Third Wife, and ſhe is but Seventeen Years of Age; but of ſuch an agreeable Humour, and ſo ingenious, that we were perfectly Charm'd with her Wit and her Perſon: It was then Ten a Clock when we got there. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are naturally Lazy, and love to riſe late; and theſe Two were yet in Bed. Her Husband gave us ſuch a frank and civil Reception, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifi'd how much he was pleas'd that we came to ſee him. He went to walk in his Gardens, whoſe Exactneſs yields in nothing to ours. I accompanied him without delay; for the Weather was very inviting, and the Trees in this Country are as forward in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> as they are in <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:151523:67"/> at the latter end of <hi>June.</hi> Indeed this is the moſt Charming Seaſon for the Enjoyment of what they call <hi>La Prima Vera,</hi> that is to ſay, the Beginning of the Spring: For when the Son begins to have more Force and Heat, it ſcorches and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Leaves, as if they had paſſed through Flames. Theſe Gardens of which I ſpeak, were adorn'd with Bowling-Greens, Fountains and Statues, and <hi>Don Auguſtin</hi> was not backward to ſhew us all the Rarities. He is much taken with them, and values not ſpending Money thereon; for he is very rich. He led us into a Gallery, where there were divers Tables of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar Wood, ſet full of Books. He immediately led us up to the Biggeſt of them, and told us, they contain'd an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſure; and that there was a Collection of Plays of the beſt Authors: Heretofore, <hi>continued he,</hi> Vertuous perſons could not think fit to go to Plays; there was nothing to be ſeen but Actions contrary to Modeſty; they heard Diſcourſes which were offenſive; the Actors made honeſt people aſham'd; there Vice was flatter'd, and Vertue condemn'd; the Scenes became bloody with Combats; the weakeſt was always oppreſt by the ſtrongeſt, and Cuſtom gave continuance to Crimes. But ſince <hi>Lopes de Vega</hi> hath ſo ſucceſsfully labour'd to reform the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Theatre, there is now nothing ſuffer'd contrary to good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Both the Favourite, the Footman and the Ploughman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguiſe, keeping to their Native Simplicity, and making that pleaſant by an ingenious turn, find the Secrets to cure our Princes, and even our Kings, of that common Diſeaſe to hear Truth, when their own Faults are repreſented. It was he who gave Rules for theſe Aſcents, and who taught them to divide their Plays into Three <hi>Jornada</hi>'s, or Acts. Since his time, we have ſeen flouriſh the <hi>Mount alvanes,</hi> the <hi>Mendoza</hi>'s, the <hi>Rojas Alarcones,</hi> the <hi>Veles,</hi> the <hi>Mira de Meſcuas,</hi> the <hi>Coellos,</hi> and the <hi>Villaizanes.</hi> But above all, <hi>Don Pedro Calderone</hi> excell'd as to the Serious and Grave Part, and even in the Comick Part he ſurpaſs'd all thoſe that went before him. I could not forbear telling him, That at <hi>Victoria</hi> I ſaw a Play, which to me ſeem'd bad enough: And if I might ſpeak my Judgment freely, I would not have them intermix with <hi>Holy Tragedies</hi> (which require great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and according to their Subjects ſhould be worthily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd) any idle or ſilly Jeſts. He reply'd, That by this I had ſaid to him, he knew the Genius of my Countrey; that he had ſeldom obſerv'd the <hi>French</hi> to like what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did; and as this Thought carry'd him to ſome diſpleaſing Reflections, I aſſur'd him, That Naturally we have no Antipathy for any Nation; That we even thought our ſelves oblig'd to do Juſtice
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151523:67"/> to our Enemies. And as to Plays, though I had yet found none to my Fancy, it did not follow but that there might be others much better and more agreeable to me. The manner of my talking to him did a little compoſe him; ſo that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to go into his Wife's Apartment, which was at the end of the Gallery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Fernand de Tollede,</hi> and the Three other Knights, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd there, becauſe it is not the Cuſtom in <hi>Spain</hi> for Men to go into Womens Chambers while they are in Bed: A Brother has not this Privilege, unleſs his Siſter be ſick. <hi>Donna Thereſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd me in as kind and obliging a manner, as if we had been long acquainted. And this muſt be confeſs'd, in praiſe of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that nothing of that ſort of Familiarity which comes from want of, or a mean Education, appears in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments; for with great Civility and Earneſtneſs they are very careful to pay what they owe to others, and at the ſame time do not forget what's due to themſelves. She was in Bed without any Coif or Cornet; her Hair was parted in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of her Forehead, ty'd behind with a Ribbon, and wrapt up with Carnation-colour'd Taffety: Her Shift was very fine, and of ſo vaſt a largeneſs, that it lookt like a Surplice; the Sleeves were as big as Mens, and button'd at the Hands with Diamonds: Inſtead of narrow Point at the Neck and Hands, ſhe had hers wrought with Blue and Fleſh-colour'd Silk in Flowers; her Ruffles were of White Taffety Pinkt. —She had ſeveral lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pillows ty'd with Ribbons, and trimm'd with very broad and fine Lace; ſhe had Baſſes all of Flowers of Point <hi>de Spain</hi> in Silk and Gold, which lookt very pretty: Her Bed was all of Copper, Gilt, with little Balls of Ivory and Ebony; her Bed-Head was adorn'd with four Rows of little Copper Balliſters, very well wrought.</p>
               <p>She ask'd me leave to riſe, but when ſhe came to put on her Stockings and Shooes, ſhe caus'd the Key to be taken out of the Door, and that to be bolted. I enquir'd the Reaſon of this Barricading: She told me, That ſhe knew there was with me ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen, and that ſhe had rather loſe her Life than they ſhould ſee her Feet. I broke out into Laughter, and begg'd her to let me ſee them; for that I could not apprehend that the thing was of that moment. It is true indeed, that for their Littleneſs, they are ſomething extraordinary; for I have ſeen Children of ſix Years old have as great. As ſoon as ſhe was up, ſhe took a little Cup full of <hi>Red,</hi> and with a good big Pencil ſhe laid it on, not only upon her Cheeks, her Chin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Noſe, above her Eye-brows, and the Edges of her Ears;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151523:68"/> but ſhe alſo be-daub'd the inſide of her Hands, her Fingers, and her Shoulders. She told me, That every Night at going to Bed, and every Morning at riſing, they laid this Colour on; That ſhe did not paint, and that ſhe was willing enough to leave the uſe of this <hi>Red,</hi> but that it was ſuch a General Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that it could not be diſpenſed with; for let one be of never ſo freſh a Colour, they would look pale and ſickly when they were near others, if they did not uſe this <hi>Red.</hi> One of her Women perfum'd her from Head to Foot, with excellent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils, the Smoak whereof ſhe made to aſcend to her; another took Orange-Flower-Water in her Mouth, and dexterouſly through her Teeth ſhe ſprinkled it like Rain upon her; and this they call <hi>Rouſſia.</hi> She told me, That there was nothing that ſpoil'd the Teeth more than this was of ſquirting it, but that the Water ſmelt better for it. Of this I doubted, and I thought it very ugly, that an Old Woman, ſuch as that was which I ſaw there, ſhould come and ſpurt Water out of her Mouth, in my Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Auguſtin</hi> having known by one of his Wife's Servants, that ſhe was dreſt, did not ſtand upon the Cuſtom of the Countrey, but lead <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and the Knights, into her Chamber. The Converſation was not long in common, but we divided; for my part, I diſcourſed with <hi>Donna Thereſa,</hi> and ſhe told me, ſhe was born at <hi>Madrid,</hi> but was brought up at <hi>Lisbon</hi> with her Grand-mother, who was Siſter to <hi>Don Auguſtin Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checo;</hi> ſo that her Husband was her great Uncle; and theſe ſort of Alliances are often contracted in <hi>Spain.</hi> She talkt to me much of the Young <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and boaſted mightily of her Wit, and told me, if I would go into her Cloſet, I might judge of her Beauty, for ſhe had her Picture there. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went, and was ſurpriz'd with the Charms I obſerv'd in this Princeſs. She had her Hair cut and curl'd like the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig of an Abbot, and an Invention for preſerving Children from falling, ſo big, that there were upon it Two Baskets of Flowers, and little Veſſels of a Medicinal Earth, of which they eat a great deal in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> although 'tis an Earth that hath little Taſte. <hi>Donna Thereſa</hi> ſhew'd me the Skin of a Serpent, which her Husband kill'd in the <hi>Indies;</hi> and though it was dead, yet I was afraid of it. Thoſe of this kind are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream dangerous; but it ſeems as if Providence had taken care to preſerve Men from them, for theſe Serpents have a ſort of Bell about their Head, which rings when they move, and ſo gives notice to Travellers to ſecure themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:151523:68"/>
               <p>This young Lady, who is a great Lover of <hi>Portugal,</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to me much in its Favour: She told me, That the Sea, which flows up into the <hi>Tagus,</hi> renders that River capable to bear the greateſt Gallions, and the faireſt Ships upon the Ocean: That the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſtands upon the ſide of a little Hill, which inſenſibly deſcends to the very Brink of the <hi>Tagus:</hi> So that the Houſes being built one above another, are all ſeen at once, and ſo becomes a very pleaſant Proſpect. The old Walls, which the <hi>Moors</hi> built about it, are yet ſtanding: There are of them four Rounds, built at divers times; the laſt may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix Leagues Circumference. The Caſtle, which ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Hill, hath its particular Beauties: In it you ſee <hi>Palaces, Churches, Fortifications, Gardens, Armories and Streets:</hi> There's always a good Garriſon with a Governor: This Fortreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the City, and from thence they may thunder upon it, in caſe it proves rebellious. The Palace where the <hi>King</hi> lives, is more conſiderable, if not for its Strength, yet for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of its Buildings: Every thing there is Great and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent; the Proſpect it has to the Sea hath made them take ſo much care to beautify it. She diſcourſed to me afterwards of the Publick Places, which are adorn'd with Vaults and Arches; and of the great Houſes round about the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Convent, where the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is, before the Gate of which there is a Fountain, with a great many Statues of White Marble, which throw the Water every way. She added, That the Fair of <hi>Roucio</hi> is kept on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> of every Week, in a Place which might be taken for an <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi> becauſe 'tis environ'd with little Hills, upon which are built ſeveral fair Palaces. There's another Place on the ſide of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> where the Market is kept; and there one may meet with every thing which can be deſired, of the beſt in his kind, either in Fowl, Fiſh, Fruits, Herbs or Pulſe. The <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> ſtands a little higher up, where there is infinite Riches and Rarities, and ſome Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are lately made to preſerve them. The Metropolitan Church is not eminent for any thing but its Antiquity: It is dedicated to St. <hi>Vincent;</hi> it is pretended, that after he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom, they refuſed him Burial, and that the Ravens watcht over his Body, till ſome pious Perſons came and took it up, and carried it to <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to have it worſhipt; and for this Reaſon there are Ravens kept in the Church; and there is a Box for them, into which are put the Alms to buy them Food.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Lisbon, continued ſhe,</hi> is a very pleaſant place to live in, yet we dwelt at <hi>Alcantara:</hi> This Village is not above a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:151523:69"/> quarter of a League from the City; There's in it a <hi>Royal</hi> Houſe, not ſo fine for its Buildings, as for its Situation; the River ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of a Canal: There one ſees admirable Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, all fill'd with Grotts and Cataracts, or great Falls of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as Spouts of Water. <hi>Belem</hi> is not far from hence: it is the place deſign'd for the <hi>Sepulture</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> in the Church of the <hi>Hieronimites:</hi> It is all covered over with White Marble; the Pillars and Statues are of the ſame; the Tombs are in even Rows in three different Chappels, amongſt which there are ſome well wrought. <hi>Belem, Feriera, Sacavin,</hi> and ſome other places about the City, are remarkable for the vaſt quantities of Oranges and Lemons growing there; the Air you ſmell there is all perfum'd; you can hardly ſit down under the Trees, but you are covered with their Flowers; one ſees running amongſt them a Thouſand little Rivulets, and it may be affirmed, that there is nothing more ſweet in the Night, than the Murmurs and Harmony which are there frequently heard. At <hi>Belem</hi> there are great Magazines of Oranges, both ſweet and ſour Lemons, Pome-Citrons and Lemons. They load them on ſmall Veſſels, and ſo tranſport them into moſt parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe ſhe told me of the Knights <hi>del Habito de Chriſto, of the Habit of Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Multitude made them leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and alſo of the <hi>Counts</hi> of the Kingdom, which have the ſame Priviledges as the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> they are poſſeſs'd of <hi>Las Comarcas,</hi> which are certain Lands belonging to the Crown, and divided into Counties of a conſiderable Value. She told me, That when the <hi>King</hi> intended to go abroad, the People had notice of it by a Trumpet, which ſounds very early in the Morning in the place through which his Majeſty is to paſs. For the <hi>Queen,</hi> 'tis a Flute and a Drum; and for the <hi>Infanta,</hi> a Hauthoy. When they all go abroad together, the Trumpet, the Drum, the Flute, and the Hautboy, march in a Company; and by this means, if any one which cannot get into the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> to preſent a Petition, he need only wait for the King's coming by. Eight Leagues from <hi>Coimbre,</hi> there's a Fountain in a place called <hi>Cedima,</hi> which draws in, and ſwallows down every thing which touches its Water; Experiments are often made upon great branches of Trees, and ſometimes of Horſes, which they cauſe to be brought there, from whence they cannot get back, but with great difficulty.</p>
               <p>But that which cauſes the greateſt wonder, added ſhe, is the <hi>Lake</hi> of the Mountain of <hi>Strella,</hi> where there are often found the wracks of Ships, broken Maſts, Anchors, and Sails, and yet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:151523:69"/> the Sea is above twelve Leagues off, and this is upon the top of a very high Hill too; it cannot be imagin'd by what means all theſe things ſhould come there. Whilſt I was hearing with great delight <hi>Donna Thereſa</hi> relate theſe things, her Husband and the reſt of the Company came and interrupted us. <hi>Don Auguſtin</hi> was a Man of Underſtanding, and for all his Age, was very pleaſant. If my Curioſity is not indiſcreet, pray, Madam, ſays he, tell me, what Subject this <hi>Child</hi> has entertained you with? <hi>Mi Tio,</hi> replied ſhe, that is, my Uncle, you may eaſily believe it was <hi>Portugal:</hi> Oh! I thought as much, cry'd he; There it is ſhe always chooſes her Field of Action. Dear <hi>God,</hi> ſays ſhe, every body has ſome place they love, and when once you are got to your <hi>Mexico,</hi> one cannot draw you from thence. You have been in the <hi>Indies,</hi> reſumed I, and <hi>Donna Thereſa</hi> hath ſhew'd me a Serpent, which ſhe ſays you kill'd there. It is true, Madam, continued he; and if it were not time for you to Dine, it would not, it may be, be unpleaſant to you to hear of what I have ſeen there. But, ſays he, I ſhould go to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> and if you pleaſe, I'll bring to you <hi>Donna Thereſa:</hi> It is there indeed, where I ſhould lay the Scene of Diſcourſe, and where I could tell you of things which I believe you would not be unwilling to know. I aſſur'd him, that he would do me a particular favour to give me ſo ſignal a mark of his kindneſs; and that I ſhould be over-joy'd to ſee the fair <hi>Donna Thereſa,</hi> and to hear her talk of the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſhe that diſcours'd ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of every thing. He took me by the Hand and led me down into a Hall paved with Marble, which was hung with Pictures inſtead of Tapiſtry, and ſet round with Cuſhions. Cloth was laid there upon a Table for the Men, but upon a Carpet on the Floor, it was laid for <hi>Donna Thereſa,</hi> my ſelf, and my Daughter.</p>
               <p>I was ſurpriz'd at this Faſhion, not having been us'd to Dine ſo; however I took no notice of it, and I had a mind to try it, but I was never more uneaſie; my Leggs ak'd moſt horribly: one while I lean'd upon my Elbow, and then upon my Hand: In a word, I could not Dine, and yet the good Lady was not ſenſible of it, for ſhe thought the Women in <hi>France</hi> were uſed to eat upon the Floor, as they did in <hi>Spain.</hi> But <hi>Don Fernand De Toledo,</hi> who obſerv'd me uneaſie, roſe from Table with <hi>Don Frederick De Cordonna,</hi> and both of them told me, that abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſhould ſit with them; I was willing enough, provided <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Thereſa</hi> would do ſo too; but ſhe durſt not, becauſe there were Men, upon whom ſhe did not ſo much as lift up her Eyes but by ſtealth. <hi>Don Auguſtin</hi> bid her come without Ceremony,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151523:70"/> and told her, that they muſt let me know, that they were glad to ſee me at their Houſe. But that which was very pleaſant, was, when this Lady was ſet upon a Chair, ſhe was no leſs at eaſe, than I was when I ſat upon the Carpet; ſhe proteſted with a pretty ſort of freedom, that ſhe never before ſat in a Chair, and that ſhe had never once thought on't. Thus we dined very merrily, and there was nothing which could be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the obliging manner of my Reception in this Houſe. I gave to <hi>Donna Thereſa</hi> ſome Ribbons, Pins, and a Fan. She was mightily pleaſed, and gave me as many thanks, as if the Preſent had been of value. Her thanks were not common, one could not obſerve in them any thing that was low or covetous. And to ſpeak truth, they have abundance of Wit and Senſe in this Country, it appears even in the ſmalleſt trifles.</p>
               <p>I had not been gone an hour from this Houſe, when I ſaw coming towards us two Coaches drawn by ſix Mules a piece, which gallop'd a great pace, and faſter than the beſt Horſes could do. I could hardly have believed that Mules could run ſo faſt. But that which I wondred moſt at, was the manner of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harnaſs'd. Theſe two Coaches and their Furniture took up almoſt a quarter of a League of room. There was one with ſix Glaſſes indifferent large, and made like ours, except that the upper part is very low, and ſo, inconvenient. Within, it had a Corniſh of Wood gilt, but ſo large, that it lookt like one for a Chamber. The Coach was gilt on the out-ſide, which is only allow'd to Embaſſadors and Strangers. The Curtains were of Damask and Cloth ſew'd together. The Coach-man rode upon one of the fore-Mules; they do not ſit in the Coach-box, although there is one; and upon my asking the Reaſon of it, <hi>Don Frederick de Cardonna</hi> told me, that he had been aſſur'd, that this Cuſtom had been ever ſince the Coach-man of the Lord Duke <hi>D' Olivares</hi> drove his Maſter, who over-hearing ſomething of great Importance which the Duke told to one of his Friends, reveal'd it; the matter having made a great noiſe at Court, (for it ſeems the Duke accus'd his Friend of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, which nevertheleſs he was innocent of) ever ſince, they have been ſo cautious to make the Coach-man ride upon the firſt Mule. Their Traces are Silk or Hempen Cords, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive long, that from one Mule to another, there's above three Ells diſtance; and I cannot underſtand, but every thing ſhould break at the rate they run. It is true, that though they run very faſt in the Country, yet they go very ſoftly in the City; and 'tis a tireſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e thing to go ſo ſlowly as if they told their ſteps. And though at <hi>Madrid,</hi> they have but four Mules,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151523:70"/> yet they have a Poſtillion. My Relation was in the firſt of theſe Coaches, with three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies. The Gentlemen and the Pages were in the other, which was not made after the ſame manner. It had Boots, as formerly our Coaches had; they are to let down, and the Leather is open at bottom, ſo that when the Women come out (if they have no mind their Feet ſhould be ſeen) the Boot is let down to the ground to hide their Shoes. It had Glaſſes twice as big as my hand, made faſt to each end of the Coach, for the conveniency of calling to the Footmen. Nothing more reſembles our Garret-windows than theſe do. The top of the Coach is covered with Gray <hi>Parragon,</hi> and the Curtains are of the ſame, large and long, hang with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and draw round, and are faſtned with Buttons and Loops; This looks very ill, and you are incloſed within as if you were in a Box.</p>
               <p>My Relation was dreſt, half <hi>French</hi> and half <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> ſhe ſeem'd over-joy'd to ſee me, and I was no leſs to ſee her. As to her Perſon, I found her not at all chang'd; but I could not forbear laughing at her way of ſpeaking: She now underſtands very little <hi>French,</hi> although ſhe continually ſpeaks and loves it ſo much, that it is impoſſible for her to learn any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: But ſhe now mixes <hi>Italian, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> with her own Natural Language; and this makes ſuch a <hi>Jargon,</hi> as is very ſtrange to one, who knew her, as I did, to have the <hi>French</hi> Language in its purity, and able to read Lectures of it to the Learned. She cannot endure to be told, that ſhe has forgot it; and indeed ſhe does not believe it, having never left off ſpeaking it, either with ſome of her own Women, or with Ambaſſadors and Strangers, who generally underſtood it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſhe ſpeaks very ill: And if one is not at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head, it is difficult long to ſpeak a Language well, which is every day changing, and continually making new progreſſes.</p>
               <p>I found the Ladies which were with her extream pretty: I do aſſure you, that there are in this Countrey ſome very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and aimable. We embraced each other often, and went back to <hi>Madrid.</hi> Before we came there we paſt over a Sandy Plain, of about Four Leagues, but ſo uneven, that every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we fell into holes big enough to bury the Coach, and which hinder'd it for going very faſt. This uneven way laſted till we came to a little Village call'd <hi>Mandes,</hi> which is but half a League from <hi>Madrid.</hi> All the Countrey here is dry, and very open; you can ſcarcely ſee a Tree on any ſide you look: The City is ſcituated in the middle of <hi>Spain,</hi> which is <hi>New-Caſtile.</hi> It is above an Age ſince the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have choſen to keep
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151523:71"/> their Court in it, becauſe of the purity of the Air, and the goodneſs of the Water, which really is ſo good and ſo light, that the <hi>Cardinal Infanta</hi> would drink no other when he was in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and he caus'd it to be brought by Sea in Earthern Jars, well ſtopt. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend, that the Founder of <hi>Madrid</hi> was a Prince nam'd <hi>Ogno Bianor,</hi> Son of <hi>Tiberino,</hi> King of the <hi>Latines,</hi> and of <hi>Manto,</hi> who was a <hi>Queen,</hi> more Famous for the Science of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> which ſhe underſtood to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful degree, than for her Birth. 'Tis thought, that <hi>Madrid</hi> muſt be in the Heart of <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe the little Village of <hi>Pinto,</hi> which is not above Three Leagues from it, is call'd in <hi>Latine, Punctum;</hi> and that is reckon'd to be in the Center of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing I obſerv'd was, that the City is not enclos'd either with a Wall or Ditch; the Gates, as one may ſay, are only made faſt by a Latch; thoſe which I have already ſeen, are all broken; there is not ſeen any place of Defence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſtle, nor in a word, any thing which might not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with throwing of Oranges and Lemons; but yet it might be neceſſary to Fortifie this City: The Mountains which are round it, are of ſome uſe for its Defence; I have paſs'd through ſome places of them, which are ſo narrow, that one might ſhut them up with a good big Stone, and with a hundred Men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the paſſage of a whole Army. The Streets are long and ſtraight, and of a good largeneſs, but there's no place worſe paved; let one go as ſoftly as 'tis poſſible, yet one is almoſt jumbl'd and ſhak'd to pieces; there are more Ditches and dirty places than in any City in the World, the Horſes go up to the Bellies, and the Coaches to the middle; ſo that it daſhes all upon you, and you are ſpoyl'd unleſs you either pull up the Glaſſes, or draw the Curtains which I have ſpoke of; very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Water comes into the Coaches at the bottom of the Boots, which are open.</p>
               <p>The Houſes there have rarely any great Gates to them, thoſe which have, are without Courts. The Doors indeed, are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large; and for the Houſes, they are very graceful, ſpacious, and convenient, though they are only built of Earth and Brick. I think they are altogether as dear as at <hi>Paris.</hi> The firſt Story which they raiſe belongs to the <hi>King,</hi> and he can either let, or ſell it, unleſs the Owner of the Houſe buy it off, which is almoſt conſtantly done, and this is a conſiderable Revenue to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is commonly in every Houſe Ten or Twelve Rooms on a Floor; in ſome Twenty and more; they have their <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:151523:71"/> and their <hi>Winter</hi> Apartments, and very often, one for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, and another for Spring-time: So that having very great Families, they are forced to Lodge them in ſome Neighbouring Houſes, which they hire on purpoſe for them.</p>
               <p>You muſt not wonder, Dear Couſin, that they have ſo many Domeſticks: There are two Reaſons for it. The firſt is, that both for Food and Wages the <hi>Spaniards</hi> give but two <hi>Rials</hi> a day, which is not above Six-pence of our Money. I ſay, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do this, for Strangers pay after the rate of four <hi>Rials,</hi> which is about Twelve pence of our Money. Neither do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> give to their Gentlemen above Fifteen Crowns a Month, with which they muſt wear Velvet in Winter, and Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety in Summer: But then they live only upon Onions, Peaſe, and ſuch mean ſtuff, and this makes the Pages and Footmen as greedy as Doggs. But I ſhould ſpeak of the other Domeſticks as well as the Pages, for in this matter they are all alike, let them have what Wages they will. They are kept ſo very hungry, that in carrying the Diſhes to the Table, they eat half the Victuals that is in them; they throw it into their Mouths ſo burning hot, that you ſhall obſerve their Teeth all rotten with the Practice. I advis'd my Kinſwoman to get a little Silver Stew-pan made and faſtned with a Pad-lock, like that I ſaw of the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Burgos,</hi> and ſhe did ſo and now after the Cook hath fill'd it, he looks through a little Grate to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soupe does well; and thus the Pages get nothing of it but the Steam. Before this Invention, it happen'd a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, that when we thought to have taken up ſome Broth, we found neither that, nor any Fleſh; for you muſt know, that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Temperate, 'tis when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is their own; they are not ſo, when they eat at another's coſt. I have ſeen Perſons of the Higheſt Quality eat with us like ſo many Wolves, they were ſo hungry: They were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough of it themſelves, and pray'd us not to wonder at it, for they found the <hi>Ragoas</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> way, ſo excellent, that they could not forbear.</p>
               <p>There are Cooks-ſhops almoſt at every corner of a Street: Theſe have great Kettles ſet upon Trevets. There folks may have ſuch ordinary things as Beans, Garlick, Leeks, or a little Broth, in which they ſteep their Bread. The Gentlemen and Waiting-women go thither as other People, for at home they only dreſs Victuals for the Maſter and Miſtreſs, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They are ſtrangely Temperate in Wine; the Women never drink any, and the Men ſo little, that a quarter of a Pint will ſerve one a whole day. You cannot affront a Man worſe,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151523:72"/> than to call him a <hi>Drunkard.</hi> Here's indeed, a great many things to make up the firſt Reaſon why they keep ſo many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Now follows the ſecond.</p>
               <p>When a great Man dies, if he had a hundred Servants, his Son keeps all he found in the Houſe, without putting one away: When the Mother happens to dye, either her own Daughter, or her Daughter-in-law takes into her Service all the Women-Servants; and this Cuſtom holds to the fourth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for they are never turn'd away. They are put, as I have told you, into Neighbouring Houſes, and have their <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or Allowances. They come often to their Maſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's Houſe, but 'tis rather to ſhew they are not dead, than to do any Service. I was to ſee the Dutcheſs of <hi>Oſſona,</hi> which is a very great Lady, and I was amazed to ſee ſo many Chamber-maids and Women, for every Room was full of them. I askt her, how many ſhe had? She told me, ſhe had now only 300, but that very lately ſhe had 500 more. If particular Perſons have this Cuſtom of keeping ſo many Servants, the <hi>King</hi> muſt needs keep abundance more, which without doubt is very chargeable to him, and muſt hurt his Affairs. I have been told, that in <hi>Madrid</hi> only, if the Penſions which he gives are reckoned, he gives <hi>Ration</hi> or Allowances to above Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perſons.</p>
               <p>As to the King's Houſe, the Proviſion for it is daily brought in, and it is regulated according to the Quality of the Perſons. There is diſtributed both tame and wild Fowl, Fiſh, Chocolate, Fruit, Ice, Charcoal, Wax-Chandles, Oyl, Bread, and in a word, every thing that is neceſſary for Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> have their certain Expences, and ſo have ſome <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> There are Perſons appointed to Sell at their Houſes whatever I have juſt now named, and that without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Cuſtom or Exciſe: And this ſaves them a great deal of Money, for the Duties upon all ſorts of Goods and Wares are exceſſive high.</p>
               <p>None but Embaſſadors and Strangers are allow'd to have a great many Footmen and Pages to follow them: For by the <hi>Pragmatick</hi> (by which name they call all their Edicts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they are forbidden to have any more than two Footmen to follow them.) It is ſomewhat ſtrange, that they who keep four or five hundred Perſons, may not be allow'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three to accompany them. This third, you muſt know, is a Groom, which goes on foot, and keeps near the Horſes, to hinder them from putting and intangling their Leggs in their long Traces, and he does not wear a Sword as the Footmen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151523:72"/> do: And I muſt needs ſay, that if Age is a recommendable Quality, theſe three Men have that in a good degree. I have ſeen Footmen of Fifty Years of Age, and never any under Thirty. They are very unpleaſant to look at, being very taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of a Clowniſh Aſpect: They cut their Hair cloſe on the top of their heads, only let a Round be a little long, but very greaſie, and ſeldom comb'd. The Hair they cut on the top of their heads, is done in the ſhape of a Wild Boar's Head. They wear long Swords, with Shoulder-Belts and Cloaks. They are all cloath'd either in Blew or Green; and often their green Cloth Cloaks are lined with blew Velvet cut in Flowers; their Sleeves are either of Velvet, Sattin, or Damask. One would think that theſe ſhould be handſome Liveries, but yet I aſſure you, nothing is uglier; and their ill Looks diſparage their Clothes. They wear Bands, but without any Collar, which is ridiculous. And upon their Cloathes they have neither Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons, nor tufted Buttons and Loops, nor any ſort of Lace or Trimming.</p>
               <p>Their Gentlemen and their Pages always go in a Coach that follows; theſe wear black Cloathes in all Seaſons: In Winter they wear Velvet, with Cloth Cloaks very long, but when they Mourn, they draw upon the ground. Although they are Pages, they wear no Swords, only moſt of them have a little Poniard hid under their Cloaths. In Summer they wear either Damask or Taffety, with Cloaks of a black Stuff very light.</p>
               <p>It is only the great <hi>Lords,</hi> and the <hi>Titulado's,</hi> or Men of <hi>Title,</hi> which are permitted to have four Mules to their Coaches with thoſe long Traces in the City. If any Perſon, without the diſtinction of ſome Character, let him be as Rich as he will, ſhould appear in the ſame Equipage, he would be affronted and abus'd in the open Street, his Traces would be cut, and himſelf Fin'd very high. Here, it is not enough to be Rich, a Man muſt alſo be of ſome Quality. The <hi>King</hi> only, can have ſix Mules to his own Coach, and to thoſe of his Attendants; which Coaches are not like others, and are diſtinguiſh'd by this, that they are covered with green Oyl-Cloth round, as well as on the top, juſt as the Stage-Coaches in <hi>France,</hi> except that they are not of Wickers but the carved Work is very coarſe, and ill done, and they have falling Boots, and all is very ugly; and one would wonder how ſo great a <hi>King</hi> can make uſe of them. But I have been told, that theſe faſhion'd Coaches were in uſe in <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's time, that his were juſt like them; and that it is in imitation of ſo great an <hi>Emperour,</hi> that all the <hi>Kings</hi> which have Reigned ſince, will have no other. Without
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151523:73"/> doubt there muſt be ſome ſuch great Reaſon; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, the <hi>King</hi> has as fine Coaches as any are in the World, ſome made in <hi>France,</hi> and others in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Parts. The great Perſons have alſo very ſtately ones; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>King</hi>'s Example, they do not uſe them four times a Year. All Coaches are kept in large Courts, in which there are ſeveral Partitions encloſed. There are it may be to the number of two hundred in one Yard, and there are ſeveral of theſe Yards or Courts in divers parts of the City. The Reaſon why they ſet them abroad is, becauſe they have no room for them at home, their Houſes being built, as I have already ſaid, without Courts or great Gates. Of late, they begin to alter their Faſhion, and uſe Horſes inſtead of Mules. And to be juſt, theſe Horſes are extream beautiful; there is nothing wanting to them, and it would be difficult for the beſt Painters to draw any in greater Perfection. But 'tis a piece of Cruelty to make them draw ſuch huge Coaches, which are almoſt as heavy as a Houſe; beſides the Streets are ſo very ill pav'd, that their Feet are quite ſpoyl'd in two Years time. They coſt very dear, and are not big enough for their Coaches. But I have ſeen ſome draw their pretty little <hi>Calaſhes,</hi> which were all painted and gilt, like thoſe which are made in <hi>Holland,</hi> and nothing look'd more pleaſant; and by their ſwift running, and handſom car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of their Heads, you would take them for Stags. As ſoon as you are out of Town you may put ſix Horſes to your Coach. Their Harneſs are very neat, and they trim their Manes, which hang to the ground, with Ribbons of divers colours; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they dreſs up their Manes with a great many puffs of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gauze, which makes a very pretty ſhew. The Harneſs for their Mules, are made of Leather, flat and broad, with which they cover them almoſt all over.</p>
               <p>Two days ago I went with my Kinſwoman to walk without St. <hi>Bernardine</hi>'s Gate. 'Tis a place they frequent in Winter. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> was there, with the Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zeda,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Altamire.</hi> He had a Harneſs for his Horſes of an <hi>Iſabella</hi> colour, which ſo pleaſed me, that I could not forbear ſpeaking to him of it when his Coach came near ours. According to Cuſtom, he told me, that he laid them all at my Feet; and at Night when we got home, I was told, that his Gentleman deſir'd to ſpeak with me. He made me a Complement, and told me, that his Maſter's ſix Horſes were in my Stable. My Kinſwoman fell a laughing, and made Anſwer for me, that I was ſo lately arriv'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that I did not yet underſtand, that one muſt not praiſe any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:151523:73"/> thing which belong'd to ſo generous a <hi>Cavaliero,</hi> as <hi>Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> but however, 'twas not the Faſhion to receive Preſents of ſo great value, and deſired him to take them back again. But this he would not do, we ſent them back immediately; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them, and ſo did we. To be ſhort, the whole Evening paſt thus in ſending backwards and forwards; and at laſt, we were forced to write him a Letter, and give our ſelves a great deal of trouble to perſwade him not to take it ill, that I would not accept them.</p>
               <p>I am told, that after the <hi>King</hi> has once made uſe of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> in Reſpect to him, no body afterwards will ride on him. It happened, that the Duke of <hi>Medina De las Torres</hi> had bought a Horſe worth Five and Twenty Thouſand Crowns, he was the handſomeſt and the braveſt which was ever ſeen. He caus'd his Picture to be taken; <hi>King Philip</hi> the Fourth ſaw it, and had a mind to ſee the Horſe. The <hi>Duke</hi> begg'd him to accept of him; but he refus'd him, and gave this Reaſon, That as he ſhould ſeldom ride on him, and that no body would make uſe of him after he had mounted him, ſo the ſtrength and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Horſe would be loſt.</p>
               <p>It is uſual here for good Families to put their younger Daughters to <hi>Ladies;</hi> by whom they are employ'd for the moſt part to Embroider in Gold and Silver, or in Silk of various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, about their Shift-Necks or Hands: But if they are left to follow their own Natural Inclination, they work very little, and talk much. They keep alſo both Male and Female-Dwarfs, and very ugly ones: The Females particularly have very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looks, their Heads are bigger than their Bodies; they always wear their Hair looſe about their Ears, and hanging down to the ground: At firſt ſight, one would wonder what theſe little Figures were when they preſent themſelves before ones Eyes. They wear Rich Cloaths; they are their Miſtreſs's Confidents, and for this Reaſon, they are deny'd nothing they have a mind to.</p>
               <p>In every Houſe at a certain ſtated hour, all the Women meet with the Miſtreſs of the Family, in the Chappel, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat their <hi>Roſary</hi> aloud; they make uſe of no Book to ſay their Prayers by; indeed it is very ſeldom they have any. The Count of <hi>Charny,</hi> who is a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> very handſom, and of great worth, and is the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s General of his Horſe in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> told me, that the other day being at <hi>Maſs,</hi> and as he was ſaying his Prayers by his Book, an Old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman came and ſnatch'd it from him, and with great Indignation threw it to the ground, ſaying to him, <hi>Let this alone, and make
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151523:74"/> uſe of your Beads.</hi> It is a ſtrange thing to conſider how conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fond they are of their <hi>Beads;</hi> every Woman there has a pair faſtned to her Girdle, and ſo long, that they almoſt touch the ground. They are perpetually without ceaſing uſing them, in the Streets, as they play at <hi>Omber,</hi> as they Diſcourſe, nay, when they are making Love, when they are telling Lies, or ſpeaking Evil of their Neighbours. They are continually mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering over their <hi>Beads,</hi> let them be in never ſo much Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nothing of this hinders them ſtill to keep on their pace. I leave you to judge what Devotion there can be in this; but Cuſtom has a great Power in this Country.</p>
               <p>Till of late, Women wore Vertingales of a prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; this Faſhion was very troubleſom to themſelves as well as others. There were hardly any doors wide enough for them to go through: But they have left them off now, and only wear them when they go to appear in the Queen's or the King's Preſence: Commonly in the City they wear a certain ſort of Veſtment, which to ſpeak properly, is <hi>a young or little Vertin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi> They are made of thick Copper Wyre in a round form, about the Girdle, there are Ribbons faſtned to them, with which they tye another round of the ſame form, which falls down a little lower, and which is wider; and of theſe they have five or ſix rounds which reach down to the ground, and bear out their Petticoats and other Garments. They wear a vaſt number of this Device; and one would hardly believe that ſo little Creatures as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women are, could bear ſuch a load. Their upper Garment is always of coarſe black Taffety, or of a grey plain Stuff made of Goats-hair, with a Truſs or Fardle coming down a little above the Knees, and round the upper Garments; and if you ask them to what end this ſerves? they'll anſwer you, that with this they can make it longer as it wears out. The <hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> as well as others, uſes this to all her Garments. Even the <hi>Carmelites</hi> wear them in <hi>France</hi> as well as in <hi>Spain.</hi> But as to Women, it is rather a Faſhion which they follow, than any Frugality; for they are neither Covetous nor good Houſewifes, and of theſe things, they have two or three new ones in a Week. Theſe upper Garments are ſo long before and on the ſides, that they draw a great deal upon the ground, but behind, they do not draw at all. Though they wear them down ſo low, yet they will tread upon them, that their Feet may not be ſeen, which are the parts they moſt induſtriouſly hide. I have heard ſay, that after a Lady has Oblig'd her Gallant by all poſſible Civilities and Compliance, to confirm to him her Kindneſs, ſhe will ſhew him her foot; and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151523:74"/> this here, they call the higheſt Favour; one muſt needs own, that in its kind, there is nothing prettier. As I have already told you their Feet are ſo ſmall, that their Shooes look like thoſe of our Babies. They are made of black <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Leather, cut upon colour'd Taffety, without Heels, and as ſtrait as a Glove. When they go, you would think they flew; we ſhould not in a hundred Years learn their way of walking; they keep their Elbows cloſe to their ſides, and go without raiſing their Feet, juſt as one ſlides. But to return to their Habits; under this plain upper Garment, they have a dozen more, one finer, than another, of rich Stuffs, and trim'd with Galloons and Lace of Gold and Silver, to the Girdle. That I have told you a dozen, pray do not think that I exceed the Truth: During the exceſſive Heats of the Summer, they only wear ſeven or eight, of which ſome are of Velvet, and others of thick Sattin. They wear at all times a white Garment under all the reſt, which they call <hi>Sabengua;</hi> it is made either of the fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lace, or of Muſlin embroider'd with Gold, and ſo wide, that they are four Ells in compaſs. I have ſeen of theſe worth five or ſix hundred Crowns. At home they wear neither the little Vertin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale nor Patens, theſe laſt are a ſort of little Sandal, made of Brocado or Velvet, ſet upon Plates of Gold, which raiſe them half a Foot, and when they have theſe, they walk very ill, and are apt to fall. They uſe but very little Whale-bone in their Stays, the midſt of which are a third part of an Ell. One can hardly ſee in other Countries Women ſo ſlender. They ſhape their Bodies before pretty high, but behind, you may ſee them to the middle of the back, they are ſo naked, and yet this is no Charming ſight, for they are all dreadful lean, though they would be very ſorry to be fat. And this is a great Error among them. Beſides, they are very ſwarthy; ſo that this brown Skin which is glew'd to their backs, muſt neceſſarily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to thoſe who are not us'd to it. They put <hi>Red</hi> upon their Shouldiers, which are all naked, as well as on their Cheeks. Neither do they want there for <hi>White,</hi> which is very good, but there are few which know how to uſe it; at firſt ſight you can diſcern it. I have ſeen ſome of a very clear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion that was Natural. Moſt of them have very fine and exact Features; in their Looks and all their Actions you may ſee a little affectation of being Courted, which their Humour does not diſſemble. It's reckon'd beautiful among them to have no Breaſts, and they take care very early to hinder them from growing big. As ſoon as they begin to appear, they bind thin pieces of Lead upon them, as cloſe as one would ſwaddle a Child.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151523:75"/> And indeed their Breaſts are as flat and even as a ſheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, except the holes and hollowneſs, which their leanneſs cauſes, and thoſe are pretty many. Their hands have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they are little, white, and well ſhap'd. Their large Sleeves, which they faſten at the bottom of their wriſts, ſtill contribute to make them appear leſs. Theſe Sleeves are made of Taffety of all colours, like thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> with Ruffles of broad Lace. Their Stays are commonly of Gold and Silver Stuffs, mix'd with lively colours; the Sleeves of them are very ſtrait, and their Silk Sleeves appear inſtead of their Shifts. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, People of Quality wear very fine Linnen; but all others wear little or none. It is ſcarce and dear, beſides, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have that fooliſh Vanity to deſire it very fine; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they had rather have but one ſuch Shift than half a dozen a little coarſe; and either lye in Bed till 'tis waſh'd, or elſe dreſs themſelves without any, which they frequently enough do. They uſe this fine Linnen after an ill manner when they waſh it; for the Women lay it upon rough ſtones, and ſo beat it hard with a ſtick, by which means, there ſhall be a hundred holes in't immediately. There's no difference between the beſt and the worſt Laundreſs; all theſe Creatures are very auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>But I return to the Womens Cloaths, which I have often left, that I might give an Account of ſeveral things which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd to me. I muſt tell you, that they wear about their Necks Bone-lace, embroider'd over either with red or green Silk, or Gold or Silver. They wear Girdles all of Medals and Reliques. There are divers <hi>Churches</hi> which have not ſo many; they wear alſo the Cord of ſome <hi>Order,</hi> either of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> or ſome other. It is a ſmall Cord, made either of black, white, or brown Wool, and is worn on the out-ſide of their Stays, and hangs down before to the edge of their Petticoats. They are full of knots, and commonly upon every knot there's a Diamond-ſtone faſtned. They make Vows to ſome Saint or other to wear their Cords; but if the reaſon of theſe Vows was enquir'd into, it would not be found very good.</p>
               <p>They have great ſtore of <hi>Jewels,</hi> the fineſt that can be ſeen. Neither is it enough to have one Sett of <hi>Jewels,</hi> as our Ladies in <hi>France</hi> have, but theſe muſt have Eight or Ten; ſome of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> others of <hi>Rubies, Emeralds, Pearls, Turkey-ſtones;</hi> and in ſhort, of all ſorts. But the Work-men ſet them very ill, for the greateſt part of the <hi>Diamond</hi> is hid, very little of it is ſeen. I ask'd the reaſon of it, and they told me, that to them, the Gold look'd as well as the Stones. But I am of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151523:75"/> Opinion, that their Lapidaries do not underſtand how to ſet ſet them better. I muſt except <hi>Verbec,</hi> who can do them well if he will take the pains.</p>
               <p>The Ladies wear at the top of their Stays a broad knot of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> from whence there hangs a Chain of <hi>Pearl,</hi> or ten or twelve knots of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> which they faſten at the other end, to their ſides. They never wear any Necklace, but they wear Bracelets, Rings, and Pendants; which laſt are longer than ones Hand, and ſo heavy, that I hare wonder'd how they could carry them without tearing out the hole of their Ears. To which they add whatever they think pretty. I have ſeen ſome have good large Watches hanging there, others Padlocks of Precious Stones, and even your fine wrought <hi>Engliſh</hi> Keys, and little Bells. They alſo carry upon their Sleeves, their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and all about their Bodies, <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> and little Images. They have their Heads ſtuck full of Bodkins, ſome made of Diamonds in the ſhape of a Flye, and others like Butterflies, whoſe colours are diſtinguiſh'd by various Stones. They dreſs their Heads after ſeveral Faſhions, but ſtill they muſt be naked; they part their Hair on the ſides of their Heads, and lay it croſs on their foreheads; it ſhines ſo, that without lying, one may ſee themſelves in it. Formerly they wore a Treſs or Lock of Hair, the worſt made that one ſhould ſee, and this fell all ſpread upon their Shoulders, leſt their own Hair ſhould mix with it, which indeed is very fine. They have uſually five-broided Rolls, to which they faſten Knots of Ribbons, or elſe Pearls, and theſe they tye altogether to their Girdles, and in Summer when they are at home, they wrap them up in a piece of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Taffety, trim'd with Thred Bonelace. They never wear any ſort of Coif, either Night or Day. I have ſeen ſome which had their Heads dreſt up with Feathers like little Children: Theſe Feathers are very curious, and ſpotted with different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which make them much more beautiful. I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, why they do not make ſuch in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Young Women, or new-marry'd, have very Rich Cloaths, and their upper Garments are colour'd and embroider'd with Gold. I was to ſee the Princeſs of <hi>Monteleon:</hi> She's a little Body, not above Thirteen Years old, and ſhe is lately marry'd to her Couſin-German, named <hi>Don Nicholas Pignatelli;</hi> her Mother is the Daughter of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be <hi>Camarera major,</hi> or firſt Maid of Honour to the new Queen. Theſe, that is to ſay, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Terra No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, D'Hijar,</hi> and <hi>Monteleon,</hi> with the Young Princeſs of the ſame Name, and her little Siſters, dwell all altogether. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:151523:76"/> of <hi>Terra Nova</hi> may be about Threeſcore Years old; my Kinſwoman is one of her intimate Friends, and ſhe receiv'd us with ſuch Civility and Kindneſs as is not uſual with her: For it may be, there is not in the World a more haughty Spirit, which her very looks declare. Her voice is harſh, ſhe ſpeaks little, and would be thought of a kind and good Nature; but if what is ſaid, be true, ſhe is not really ſo: One ſhall hardly meet with a greater ſhare of Wit, and a more piercing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than ſhe has; ſhe diſcours'd to us much of the Place ſhe was going to take upon her in the Queen's Houſe. Says ſhe, I'll neglect nothing to make my ſelf acceptable to her, I'll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcover every thing that may pleaſe her; I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a Young Princeſs, born in <hi>France,</hi> muſt be allow'd a greater Liberty than an <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> born at <hi>Madrid.</hi> So that by me, ſhe ſhall not be able to find any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this and her own Country. She preſented me with a pair of Beads of <hi>Paulo D'Aguila,</hi> which is a curious ſort of Wood that comes from the <hi>Indies.</hi> Really they are ſo long, that when I hold them in my hands they reach to the ground. They are trim'd with two bunches of ſmall green Taffety Ribbon, each bunch has about three hundred Ells in it. She gave me alſo ſome <hi>Puoatos</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which are Pots and Diſhes made of that Medicinal Earth, and are adorn'd with Filigrane Work: And ſhe preſented me likewiſe with ſeveral other pretty Toys.</p>
               <p>One can hardly ſee any thing that looks more ſplendid than this Houſe of theirs; they uſe the upper Apartments, which are hung with Tapiſtry all done with rais'd Work of Gold. In one great Chamber, which is longer than 'tis broad, you may ſee ſeveral Glaſs-doors which go into Cloſets or little Cells. The firſt of which is the Dutcheſs of <hi>Terra Nova</hi>'s, hung with grey, and a Bed of the ſame, and all other things very plain. On one ſide Lodges her Daughter, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Monteleon,</hi> who is a Widow, and has her Room furniſh'd like her Mother's. Afterwards you come to the Princeſs of <hi>Monteleon</hi>'s Chamber, which is not larger than the others, but her Bed is of Gold and green Damask, lin'd with Silver-Brocade, and trim'd with Point <hi>De Spain.</hi> The Sheets were lac'd about with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lace of half an Ell deep. Over againſt it were the Chambers of <hi>Monteleon and Hijar</hi>'s Children, which were Furniſh'd with white Damask. Next to theſe is the little Chamber of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Hijar,</hi> Furniſh'd with Crimſon-colour'd Velvet upon a Gold Ground. Their Rooms were no otherwiſe divided than by Partitions of a certain Sweet Wood; and they told me, that ſix of their Women lay in their Chambers, upon Beds brought thither at Night.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:151523:76"/>
               <p>The Ladies were in a great Gallery, ſpread with a very rich Foot-cloth; there were ſet round it Crimſon-colour'd Velvet Cuſhions embroider'd with Gold, and they are longer than they are broad: There were alſo ſeveral great Cabinets in laid and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Precious Stones, but they are not made in <hi>Spain;</hi> and between them were Tables of Silver, and admirable Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſſes, both for their largeneſs and rich Frames, the worſt of which were of Silver. But that which I thought fineſt, were their <hi>Eſcaparates,</hi> which is a certain ſort of a cloſe Cabinet with one great Glaſs, and fill'd with all the Rarities which one can imagine, whether it be in <hi>Amber-greaſe, Porceline, Cryſtal, Bezoar-ſtone, Branches of Coral, Mother of Pearl, Fillagran in Gold,</hi> and a thouſand other things of Value. There I ſaw a Fiſh, and upon its Head there was a little Tree; it was neither of Wood nor of Moſs; it grew on the top of the Fiſh's ſcull, which is very ſmall. This ſeem'd to me a great Curioſity.</p>
               <p>We were above threeſcore Women in this Gallery, and not ſo much as one Man among us. They all ſat down upon the Floor croſs-legg'd. This is an Old Cuſtom, which they have deriv'd from the <hi>Moors.</hi> There was only one great Elbow-Chair of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Leather ſtitch'd with Silk, and very ugly. I ask'd for whom it was deſign'd? They told me it was for the Prince of <hi>Monteleon,</hi> who came not in till after all the Ladies were retir'd. I could not long ſit after this faſhion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I got ſome Cuſhions under me, five or ſix of which were faſtned together by a Silver brace full of Olive-ſtones, that it might not break through. When any Lady comes to Viſit, the <hi>He</hi> or <hi>She-Dwarf</hi> comes to give Notice, by kneeling down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Knee, upon which all the Company riſes, and the Young <hi>Princeſs</hi> walks before as far as the Door to receive her which comes to ſee her after her Marriage. In Saluting each other, they do not kiſs, perhaps, that is, becauſe they will not rub off the colour from one anothers Faces; but they ſhake Hands with their Gloves off, and in Diſcourſe, they ſay <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee;</hi> and without calling one another either, <hi>Madam,</hi> or <hi>Lady,</hi> or <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>Excellency,</hi> they only ſay, <hi>Donna Maria, Donna Clara,</hi> or <hi>Donna Thereſa.</hi> I was willing to know the reaſon of this Familiar way, and I learnt it was to avoid all occaſion of Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and that as there were different ways of ſpeaking to diſtinguiſh the great difference of Quality and Degree, and that it was not eaſie to obſerve all the Rules about them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſometimes giving diſtaſte; therefore to prevent which, they have choſen to ſpeak to each other without any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all. I muſt alſo add, that the Women here do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151523:77"/> and ſo theſe are always Perſons of Quality together. The Wives of the Long Robe never ſo much as go to viſit the Court-Ladies, and a Man of Birth ever Marries with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Quality. Here one never ſees thoſe which are not Gentlemen mix with the Nobility, as in <hi>France;</hi> ſo that there can be little danger, as long as they Aſſociate together. If there comes in a hundred Ladies one after another, every one riſes up as often, and they go, as in Proceſſion, as far as the Anti-Chamber to receive them. I was ſo tyr'd that day, that I was in a very ill Humour.</p>
               <p>They were all very well dreſs'd; and as I have already told you, they have very rich Cloaths, and their Jewels are extream fine. There were two Tables for the Game of <hi>Ombro,</hi> at which they play'd very high, and without any Noiſe. I could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Cards; they are as thin as Paper, and painted after a quite different way from ours. One of thoſe Cards looks as if one held a Letter; when they have a good Game in Hand, it were eaſie for a Cheating Gameſter to diſcover ſeveral of their Cards, if not the whole Game.</p>
               <p>While they play'd, they diſcours'd of News, of the Court and the City: Their Converſation is free and pleaſant, and it muſt needs be confeſs'd, that they have a certain quickeneſs of Wit, which we cannot come up to. They are very kind and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they love to praiſe, and do it after a gentile way, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, and with great Judgment. I am amaz'd to find ſuch ſtrength of Memory joyn'd with ſo great a degree of Wit and Underſtanding. They are compaſſionate, even almoſt to a fault. They Read little and Write not much; but yet by that little which they do Read, they improve much, and that little they Write is both exact and conciſe.</p>
               <p>Their Features are very regular and delicate; but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive leanneſs offends one that is not us'd to it. They are of a brown Complexion, and their faces very ſmooth: The Small-Pox muſt needs not do them ſo much hurt here, as in other Countries, for I have ſeldom ſeen any mark'd with them.</p>
               <p>Their Hair is as black as Jett, and very ſhining, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there is cauſe to think that they comb long with one and the ſame Comb, for t'other day I ſaw at the Merchioneſs of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connizas</hi> (who is Siſter to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and whoſe firſt Husband was the Count and Duke of <hi>Olivares</hi>) her Toylet ſpread; and although ſhe is one of the neateſt and richeſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Toylet was laid upon a little Silver Table, yet it was only furniſh'd with a little bit of Callico, a Looking-Glaſs no bigger than ones Hand, two Combs, and a little Box, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:151523:77"/> in a ſmall <hi>China</hi> Cup ſome White of an Egg beat together with Sugar-candy. I ask'd one of her Women what ſhe did with this; ſhe told me, this was to take the dirt off her Face, and to make it ſhine. I have ſeen ſome whoſe Faces were ſo bright, that you would wonder. One would think that they were Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd over; and the Skin is ſo pull'd and rub'd, that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it does a great deal of hurt. Moſt of the Women make themſelves Eye-brows, and they have only as 'twere a little thred of Hair, which in my mind looks very ugly; but that which is yet worſe, is, they comb the middle of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads ſo much till they make their Eye-brows meet; and this with them is extream Beautiful.</p>
               <p>But yet there are a great many whoſe Fancies do not lye this way; I have ſeen ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women more exact to the Rules of Beauty than our <hi>French</hi> Women, notwithſtanding their way of dreſſing croſs-wiſe, and the little Advantage which they give to their faces. One may ſay, that they are like things made out of Rule, for they have neither Hair, nor Cornet, nor any Ribbon, to ſet them off; and yet, what Country can ſhew ſuch Eyes as theirs? They are ſo very ſprightly, and declare ſo much Wit, and by them, talk to one in a Language ſo kind and intelligible, that if they had no other Charms, theſe alone would make them paſs for handſom Women, and unavoidably ſteal away ones Affections. Their Teeth are very even, and would be white enough, if they took a little care of them, but they neglect them; and beſides, their frequent uſe of <hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Chocolate</hi> does them much hurt. They have all a bad Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom here, the Women as well as the Men, which is to pick their Teeth, let them be in what Company they will: This they reckon as a Diverſion, and do it with grave looks. They do not ſo much as know what belongs to having them clean'd by an Artiſt, there is no ſuch Trade there, and when they need them to be drawn out, they get the Surgeons to do it, if they can.</p>
               <p>At my firſt coming in to Viſit the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Monteleon,</hi> I was ſurpriz'd to ſee ſo many Young Ladies with great Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles on their Noſes, and faſtned to their Ears; but that which yet ſeem'd ſtrangeſt to me, was, that they made no uſe of them where it was neceſſary: They only diſcours'd while they had them on; I was diſturb'd at it, and ask'd the Marchioneſs <hi>De la Roſa</hi> (with whom I have contracted a dear Friendſhip) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it: She's a pretty ſort of Woman, and underſtands how to live. She has a neat Wit, and is a <hi>Neapolitan.</hi> She fell a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151523:78"/> Laughing at my Queſtion, and told me, that it was done to make them look grave, that they did not wear them for any need, but to draw Reſpect. Do you ſee that Lady, ſays ſhe to me? meaning one that was near us, I do not believe, that ſince ſhe was Ten Years Old, ſhe ever left them off, but when ſhe went to Bed. Without lying, they both eat with them, and in the Streets and Aſſemblies you can never fail of meeting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Men and Women with their Spectacles. Upon this occaſion, I muſt needs tell you, continu'd ſhe, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ago, the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Fryars had a Suit in Law of high Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; the ſucceſs of which they were too much concerned for, to neglect any means. One of the Young <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Convent had ſome Kindred of the greateſt Quality, which upon his Account did ſollicit very hard on their behalf. The <hi>Prior</hi> aſſur'd him, that if through his Credit and Intereſt they ſhould get the better of the Suit, he could ask nothing that ſhould not be granted him for an Acknowledgment: At laſt, they gain'd their Point, and the Young Father, tranſported with Joy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ran to tell the News, and at the ſame time prepar'd himſelf to ask a Favour which a long time he had had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſire to obtain. But the <hi>Prior,</hi> after having embrac'd him, with grave looks and tone, ſaid to him, <hi>Hermano, ponga las Ojalas,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Brother, put on Spectacles.</hi> The Honour of this Permiſſion filled the Young Monk with a ſtrange Joy; he thought himſelf and his care too highly recompens'd, and had nothing elſe to ask. The Marqueſs of <hi>Aſtorgas,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> added ſhe, had his Statue to the middle cut in Marble, upon which he was very careful to cauſe his beſt Spectacles to be put. It is ſo common a thing to wear them, that I have heard, there are different Spectacles, according to the different Qualities and Degrees of Men and Women. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as a Man's Fortune riſes, he increaſes in the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spectacle-Glaſſes, and wears them higher upon his Noſe. The <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> wear them as broad as ones Hand, which for diſtinction, they call <hi>Ocales.</hi> They faſten them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their Ears, and leave them off as ſeldom as they do their Collars. Heretofore they had the Glaſſes of them from <hi>Venice;</hi> but ever ſince the Enterprize of the Marqueſs of <hi>Cueva,</hi> which was called the <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> becauſe they were three Perſons who undertook to Fire the Arſenal of <hi>Venice</hi> with Burning-Glaſſes, and by this means to make the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Maſter of that City: The <hi>Venetians,</hi> to be reveng'd, caus'd a vaſt number of thoſe <hi>Ocales</hi> to be made, and ſent to their Embaſſador at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi> He preſented of them to the whole Court, and all that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:151523:78"/> us'd them were almoſt blinded with them; for they were made of burning Glaſs, and very artificially done, and ſet in certain Frames made of combuſtible Matter, which with the leaſt Rays of the Sun would put all in a Flame. It happen'd upon a Council-day, that in the Room where they ſat, one of the Windows was left open, and the Sun ſhining perpendicularly upon their Spectacles, all on a ſudden they perceiv'd a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſort of fire contriv'd againſt their Eye-brows and Hair; one can hardly imagine what a fright theſe venerable old men were in. I could wiſh, ſaid I to the <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> that this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were credible, for 'tis very pleaſant. As I did not ſee it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe in ſmiling, ſo I cannot poſitively aſſure you that 'tis true: But the bus'neſs of the <hi>Jacobite Fryars</hi> which I have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, I had from the beſt Authority. I have ſince, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſeveral Perſons of Quality in their Coaches, ſometimes alone, and ſometimes in Company, with theſe great Spectacles hung upon their Noſes, which in my Mind, is a ſtrange ſight.</p>
               <p>This Princeſs gave us a Collation, her Women, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eighteen, brought every one of them a great Silver Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon full of dry Sweet-meats, wrapt up in Paper, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe cut and gilt. In one, there was a Plum, in another a Cherry or an Apricock, and ſo in all the reſt accordingly. This to me ſeem'd very neat, for by this way, one might either eat or carry away, without ſoyling the Fingers or Pockets. There were ſome ancient Ladies, who after they had eat of theſe Sweet-meats till they were ready to burſt, fill'd five or ſix Handkerchiefs full, and they bring them on purpoſe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are well obſerv'd, yet no notice ſeems to be taken, but they are ſuffer'd to take as much and as oft as they will; they tye theſe Handkerchiefs with ſtrings quite round their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vertingales: This is like the hook which is us'd in a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, upon which is hung all ſorts of Fleſh and Fowl. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they preſent you with Chocolate, every one a China Cup full upon a little Diſh of Agat ſet in Gold, with Sugar in a Box of the ſame. There was ſome Chocolate order'd with Ice, and ſome hot, and ſome made with Milk and Eggs: One drinks it with ſome Bisket, or elſe with ſome thin bread as hard as if it were toaſted, which they make ſo on purpoſe. There are ſome Women which will drink ſix Cups one after another, and this they do, very often twice or thrice a day. One ſhould not wonder that they are ſo dry, ſince nothing is hotter than this Liquor; and beſides, they eat every thing ſo very high ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd with Pepper and Spice, that one would think it impoſſible they are not burnt up: There were ſeveral alſo, which eat
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151523:79"/> great pieces of the Medicinal Earth. I have already told you, that they have even a great paſſion for this Earth, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſes in them great Obſtructions; their Stomachs and their Bellies will be ſwell'd with it, and become as hard as a Stone, and they themſelves as yellow as Saffron. I had a mind to taſte this <hi>Ragoue</hi> which is ſo much eſteem'd beyond its worth, but I declare I had rather eat a piece of a Stone.</p>
               <p>If one had a mind to oblige them, one muſt treat them with ſuch kind of things which they call <hi>Barros;</hi> and very often their Confeſſors enjoyns them no other <hi>Penance,</hi> than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear one whole day from eating thereof. It is ſaid to have a great many Properties; and is good againſt Poyſon, and cures abundance of Diſeaſes. I have a great Cup made of it, which holds a pint; it ſpoils Wine that's put into it, but it makes Water excellent, which ſeems as if it boyl'd in it, at leaſt one may obſerve it to work and fret, if it is proper to ſay ſo; and if one leaves it a little while, the Cup ſhall be quite empty, the nature of the Earth makes it ſo full of Pores; it has a ſtrong ſent. We drank Water there, which was very well order'd; one may truly ſay, that in no place they drink it cooler: They make uſe only of Snow, and are of Opinion that it cools much better than Ice; It is the cuſtom here to drink very cold Water before they take their Chocolate, which otherwiſe they think would be unwholſom.</p>
               <p>After the Collation was ended, Flamboys were brought in; there came in firſt a little ſimple Fellow, white with Age, who was Governour of the Pages: He had a great Gold Chain and a Medal about his Neck; this was the preſent he had at the Prince of <hi>Monteleon</hi>'s Marriage: He kneel'd down upon one Knee in the middle of the Gallery, and aloud, ſaid, <hi>Let the Moſt Holy Sacrament be prais'd;</hi> to which every body anſwer'd, <hi>For ever:</hi> This is their Cuſtom, when Light is brought in. Next came in four and twenty Pages following two by two; and in the ſame manner kneel'd upon one Knee; every one of them brought two great Flamboys, or one Branch, and when they had plac'd them upon the Tables, went out with the ſame Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. And then all the Ladies made to each other a low bow, accompany'd with a wiſh, as when they ſneeze. It is fit I ſhould tell you, that theſe Branches are full of Lamps faſtned to a ſilver Pillar, whoſe foot is very broad; there are moſt times eight and twelve Pipes to every Lamp, in which the Week burns, ſo that this gives a very great Light. And to encreaſe it yet more, they faſten a ſilver Plate to it, in ſuch manner, that the Light reflects upon it. One is not troubled
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151523:79"/> with the Smoak, and the Oyl they burn is altogether as good as that of <hi>Provence,</hi> which is eat with Sallads. I lik'd this faſhion very well. When all the Lights were put in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Gallery, the young Princeſs of <hi>Monteleon</hi> bid her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bring her Wedding-cloaths, that I might ſee them; they brought thirty ſilver Baskets full, which were as deep and as wide, as Table Baskets; they were ſo heavy, that there were four Women to carry one Basket. In them there was, what ever is poſſible to be ſeen that is fine and rich, according to the faſhion of the Country; amongſt other things, there were ſix of a certain ſort of cloſe Coat of Gold and Silver Brocard, made like Veſts to wear in a Morning, with Buttons, ſome of Diamonds, and others of Emeralds, and of theſe every one had ſix dozen. The Linnen and the Lace were not inferiour to the reſt. She ſhew'd me her Jewels alſo, which were admirable, but ſo ill ſet, that the biggeſt there made no better a ſhew than a Jewel ſet in <hi>Paris,</hi> which one might buy for thirty <hi>Lew</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>I will not write to you often, becauſe I will always have a ſtock of News to tell you, which in this place, is pretty long in picking up. Pardon this tedious Letter, and the little Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which I have obſerv'd in it; I ſet things down juſt as they come into my Mind, and that's ill enough; but in your Love, dear Coſin, I am ſafe from all my faults.</p>

               <p>I Fear you'll take it ill that I have omitted writing to you one Poſt; but dear Couſin, I was willing to be inform'd of divers things, which I am now going to relate.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I will ſpeak of the Churches of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which I find extream beautiful and neat: The Women of Quality ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom go to them, becauſe they all have their Chappels in their Houſes; but there are certain days in the year, they never fail to be at them, of which number are all the days in the <hi>Paſſion-week;</hi> and there alſo they make their<note n="*" place="margin">Go to receive their Indulgences.</note> 
                  <hi>Stations,</hi> and ſometimes go to Confeſſion.</p>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:151523:80"/>
               <p>Our Ladies Church of <hi>Atocha,</hi> that is to ſay, our Lady of the <hi>Buſh,</hi> is indeed a very fine one. It ſtands within a vaſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi> which is fill'd with <hi>Religious</hi> Women, who ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out of it, that being one of their Rules they are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. They lead an auſtere Life; and from all parts, People come to pay their Devotion here; and when the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have gain'd any Victories or happy Succeſs, thither they go to ſing <hi>Te Deum.</hi> There you'll ſee a <hi>Virgin</hi> holding a young <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> which they report to be miraculous. She's of a black Complexion, and very often they dreſs her up like a Widow; but upon great Feſtivals ſhe is richly cloth'd, and ſo adorn'd with Jewels, that nothing can be ſeen more magnificent. She hath in a particular manner the Sun drawn rown her Head, whoſe Beams ſhine admirably. She always has a vaſt pair of Beeds either in her Hand, or hung at her Girdle. This Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is on one ſide of the body of the Church, and in ſuch a place, as it would be very dark, were it not that there's conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually burning above an hundred great Lamps of Gold and Silver. The King has his Gallery there, whoſe fore-part is made up with a Lattice Window. In all their Churches they make uſe of Haſſocks to kneel on; and when a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or a ſtrange Lady comes in, the Sexton ſpreads a large Carpet before 'em, upon which he either ſets an Oratory with Cuſhions, or elſe he leads 'em to certain little Cloſets, all painted and gilt, with Glaſs-windows round, where one is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently placed. There never fails a Sunday that the Altar is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>kewiſe adorn'd with a prodigious quantity of Plate, and ſo are all the Churches in <hi>Madrid.</hi> Here are abundance of fine Walks made of your green Turf; and ſet full of Flowers, in which they place a great many Fountains, from whence the Water falls into Baſins, either of Silver, or Marble, or Porphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-ſtone. Round about them they plant great numbers of Orange-Trees, as high as a Man, and theſe are ſet in very fine Boxes; and among theſe they turn looſe ſeveral Birds, which make a pretty ſort of Muſick. And this as I have deſcribed to you, laſts almoſt all the year; neither are their Churches ever without Orange or Jaſſemin Trees, which perfume them much better than their Incenſe.</p>
               <p>In the Chappel which they call our Lords of <hi>Almunada,</hi> you ſee a <hi>Virgin,</hi> which they tell ye St. <hi>James</hi> brought from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and hid in a Tower which is in the middle of <hi>Madrid.</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> having beſieg'd the City, the Inhabitants were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſo great a want of Proviſions, that they were delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151523:80"/> to Surrender, when on a ſudden they found this Tower full of Corn; they concluded ſuch a plentiful and ſeaſonable Supply could be no leſs than the effect of a Miracle; this fill'd them with Joy and new Courage, and made them ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly defend the City, that the <hi>Moors</hi> toyl'd with a long Siege, were forced to retire. Afterwards, they found the Image of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and in gratitude, they built a Chappel for her, upon the Walls of which, this whole Hiſtory is painted in <hi>Freſco.</hi> The Altar, Rayles, and all the Lamps are of ſolid Silver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minime</hi> Fryars have a Church near this, in which is the Chappel of our <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Soledad,</hi> where the <hi>Salutation</hi> is every Night ſaid; this is a place of great Devotion; I mean for thoſe that are truly devout, for there are a great many Perſons which make it their Rendezvouz for other ends.</p>
               <p>But St. <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s Chappel ſurpaſſes all in beauty. He is the Patron of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and he was but a poor Labourer. The Walls of the Chappel are all caſed with Marble of divers Colours, and its Pillars are of the ſame, and ſo are ſome Statues of certain Saints: His Tomb is in the middle, and four Pillars of Porphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſupports over it a Crown cut in Marble, in which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Flowers, whoſe Colours are ſo very natural, that one may ſay, Art has outdone Nature. The <hi>Cupulo</hi> without is adorn'd with the Images of the Twelve Apoſtles, which ſtand round it.</p>
               <p>I ſaw at St. <hi>Sebaſtines,</hi> (which at preſent is my Pariſh) a Canopy which the Queen-Mother caus'd to be made, for the carrying the Holy Sacrament to the Sick in bad Weather: It is made of Crimſon Velvet embroider'd with Gold; it is cover'd with Chagrin, and nail'd with Gold Nails; it has ſeveral great Glaſſes about it, and in the middle of its roof, there is rais'd a ſort of Steeple, which is full of little Bells of Gold, Four Prieſts carry it when any Perſon of Quality is ſick, and deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, and all the People at Court attend it. There are about a thouſand Flamboys of white Wax to give Light, and ſeveral muſical Inſtruments play before it. They make ſome ſtay at all the great Places in their way, to give leave to the People to kneel and receive the Benediction, and to let the Muſicians play upon their Harps and Guittars, and ſing to them. It is generally in the Night time, that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it with ſo much Ceremony and Reſpect.</p>
               <p>When they are to celebrate a Feſtival in ſome Church, the Evening before they ſet up a long Pole faſtned in the Ground, on the top of which is a kind of a deep Chaffing-diſh, which they fill with wooden Chips mixt with Brimſtone and Oyl:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151523:81"/> This burns a long while, and gives a very great Light; they place theſe Poles in the form of Allies, which make a delightful ſort of an Illumination.</p>
               <p>The Women which go abroad to <hi>Maſs,</hi> hear a dozen of them, but ſhew ſo much Diſtraction and wandring of Thoughts, that one may eaſily perceive their Minds are employ'd on ſome other thing than their Prayers. They wear Muffs that are above half an Ell long; they are made of the fineſt Martins and Sables which can be ſeen, and are worth 4 or 5 hundred Crowns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. They muſt ſtretch back their Arms as far as poſſible they can, to be able only to put their fingers ends into the entrance of their Muffs. I fancy, I have already told you that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are extream little, and theſe Muffs are very little leſs than themſelves. They always wear a Fan too, and be it in Summer or Winter, they never ceaſe fanning themſelves all the time of <hi>Maſs.</hi> In the Church they all ſit upon their Legs, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually taking of Snuff, and yet never ſmut themſelves with it, as 'tis uſual; for in this, as in all other things, they have very neat and dextrous ways of management. Every time the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> is made, both the Women and Men give themſelves a ſcore of blows with their fiſts upon their Breaſts; which makes ſuch a noiſe, that the firſt time I heard it, I was very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, and thought they were beating one another.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Cavalleros,</hi> (I mean thoſe which by Profeſſion are Gallants, and wear a peice of Crape round their Hats) as ſoon as <hi>Maſs</hi> is ended, they march up to the place where the <hi>Holy Water</hi> is kept, and ranging themſelves round it, they preſent of it to all the Ladies, who alſo come thither, and at the ſame time ſay ſomething to them that's kind; to which the Women make a pertinent anſwer in few words; for it muſt needs be granted, that they ſpeak preciſely what they ſhould, and that <hi>ex tempore,</hi> without any trouble of ſtudying for words. But the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio,</hi> has upon pain of Excommunication, forbid the Men to preſent the Women any <hi>Holy Water.</hi> And 'tis ſaid, that this Prohibition was obtain'd at the Intreaty of ſome jealous Husbands. However it be, it is obſerv'd, and they ſay, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition even forbids the Men to give each other any <hi>Holy Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women be of what quality they will, they neither have Cuſhions in the Church, nor any kind of Train held up. For our parts, as ſoon as we appear there in our <hi>French</hi> Cloaths, every body gets round about us; but the moſt troubleſome of all, are the big belly'd Women, which are more inquiſitive than the others, and for whom they have here, the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151523:81"/> greateſt reſpect and complaiſance; for 'tis pretended, that if they long for any thing, and miſs of it, they receive ſo much hurt, that they immediately miſcarry; ſo that they have a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pull off ones Gloves, and to tugg, hale, and examine every body as they liſt.</p>
               <p>At firſt, I could not take ſuch kind of Jeſting, and talkt to them ſo roughly, that ſome of them went away weeping, and durſt not return: But there were others which were not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily put out of Countenance; they would ſee my Shooes, my Garters, and what I had in my Pocket; my Kinſwomen ſeeing I would not permit them, told me that if the People once took notice of me, they would certainly ſtone us, and bid me let them have their humour. My Women and Chamber-maids were yet worſe tormented than I; and I am aſham'd to tell you, how far the curioſity of theſe big-belly'd Women proceeded.</p>
               <p>I was told that there was a young man at Court, who was deſperately in love with a very fine Woman, whoſe Husband continually kept under his Eyes; ſo that finding no other way to ſpeak to her, he diſguis'd himſelf like a Woman big with Child, and ſo went to her Houſe; he addreſs'd himſelf to the jealous Husband, and told him, he had the <hi>Lantajo</hi> (which is the word for Longing) to diſcourſe with his Wife in private. The Husband deceiv'd by this appearance, made no queſtion that this was a young big belly'd Woman, and immediately conſented that his Wife ſhould make this Perſon happy with a long and pleaſant audience.</p>
               <p>When any of theſe Women long to ſee the King, they give him notice of it, and he has the Goodneſs to come into a great Balcon, which looks into the Palace Court, and there he tarries as long as they deſire.</p>
               <p>Not long ſince a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman juſt come from <hi>Naples,</hi> ſent to beg the King that ſhe might ſee him, and when ſhe had lookt upon him as long as ſhe had a mind, in a tranſport of Zeal, with hands lifted up, ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>I beſeech God, Sir, that of his Mercy, he would one day make you Vice Roy of Naples.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that this Paſſage was acted before the King, to inform us, that the Magnificence of the then <hi>Vice Roy,</hi> who was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, far exceeded his. Very frequently there comes into my Relation's Houſe, Women which are perfect Strangers, to whom nevertheleſs ſhe is very kind and civil, becauſe they are big with Child, and ſuch we muſt not vex.</p>
               <p>Thanks to Heaven, Lent is over, and though I only obſerv'd the Paſſion-Week, yet that was more tedious to me, than a whole Lent kept at <hi>Paris,</hi> for there's no Butter here; that little
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151523:82"/> which one meets with, is brought about Thirty Leagues off, wrapt up like Sauſages in Hoggs Bladders. It is full of Worms, and very dear. But the Oyl makes amends, for 'tis very excellent; only you know, every body loves it not, and I am one of thoſe, which cannot eat it, without being very ſick.</p>
               <p>That which makes it yet worſe here, is, that Fiſh is very ſcarce; it is impoſſible to have any ſweet which is caught in the Sea, for that is diſtant from <hi>Madrid</hi> above Fourſcore Leagues. Sometimes there is Salmon brought, of which they make Pies, which being ſeaſon'd with Spice and Saffron, is eatable. There's very little Freſh-water Fiſh, and yet for all this, they do not ſuffer much Inconvenience, for indeed, there's hardly any body keeps Lent, neither Maſter nor Servant, becauſe of the great want of Proviſions. They take a Licenſe from the Pope's <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> which coſts about a Shilling, which gives them leave to eat Butter and Cheeſe all <hi>Lent,</hi> and the Heads, Feet, and Inwards of Fowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every Saturday throughout the Year. And it ſeems to me pretty odd, that on this day they ſhould eat the Feet, Head, and Inwards, and yet dare not eat of any other part of the ſame Creature.</p>
               <p>The Shambles are as open in <hi>Lent,</hi> as they are in the <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</hi> Their way of ſelling Meat is very troubleſom; it is cloſe ſhut up in the Butcher's Shop, one ſpeaks to him through a little Window, and deſires to buy of him half a Calf, or the like; he neither vouchſafes to anſwer you, nor to ſhew you the leaſt bit of Meat; at laſt, you are content with a Loyn of Veal; but he makes you pay your Money down before-hand, and then through his little Window he gives you a Leg of Mutton; you return it, and tell him, this is not what you ask for; he takes it again, and inſtead thereof he gives you a ſhort Rib of Beef; then you make a noiſe for your Loyn, but he concerns himſelf no further than to throw you your Money, and ſhut the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow upon you. This vexes one, and you go to another, and he treats you after the ſame manner, if not worſe; ſo that it is beſt, to tell them how much Meat you would have, and leave the reſt to them. This Fleſh is ill for the Stomach, it is ſo lean, dry, and black; but as bad as 'tis, yet there's leſs requir'd of it than of ours in <hi>France,</hi> to make a good Soup. Every thing here nouriſhes ſo extreamly, that an Egg does one more good than a Pigeon elſewhere; and this I take to be an Effect of the Climate.</p>
               <p>As to their Wine, it does not pleaſe me; this is not the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where the Excellent <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine is drank, that comes from <hi>Andalouſia</hi> and the <hi>Canary-Iſlands,</hi> which muſt paſs the Sea too,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151523:82"/> to gain that ſtrength and pleaſantneſs which we find in it. At <hi>Madrid</hi> the Wine is ſtrong enough, if not too ſtrong, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wants that delicious taſte. Add to this, that they keep it in Bags made of Buck-skin, and fitted up for that purpoſe, ſo that it always ſmells and taſtes either of Pitch, or as if it was burnt. I now begin not to wonder that Men are ſo temperate with ſuch Liquor. They'll ſell as little a quantity of it as one will, even to the value of a <hi>French Double:</hi> But that which is ſo retail'd out to the poor People, is yet made worſe than it would be, by their letting it ſtand all day in an open Earthen Baſon, out of which they ſell to thoſe who have a mind. It grows ſour, and ſmells ſo ſtrong, that it makes one's Head ake in paſſing by.</p>
               <p>Lent makes no alteration in their Pleaſures, indeed they are ſo moderate, or at leaſt thoſe they uſe make ſo little noiſe, that they enjoy them at all times.</p>
               <p>No body fails of going to their <hi>Station</hi> in Paſſion-Week, but particularly from Wedneſday to Fryday. In theſe three days, there is acted very different things, by real <hi>Penitents, Lovers,</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> There are divers Women, which under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Devotion, conſtantly go to certain Churches, where for a Year before, they are aſſur'd to meet him they Love; and though they are attended with ſeveral of their Women, which they call <hi>Duennas,</hi> yet as the Crowds are great, and Love makes them ingenious, ſo they make a ſhift in ſpight of all the <hi>Argus</hi>'s, to ſlip on one ſide into a little adjoyning Houſe, which by a private ſign they know, and is hired for that purpoſe, and without the help of any body, but at that very moment of time. When they have done, they return to the ſame Church, where they find their Women buſie in ſearching for them; they fall a chiding them for their careleſneſs in loſing them; and thus the Husband, who for a whole Year hath induſtriouſly watch'd his dear Wife, loſes her at that very ſeaſon when ſhe is obliged to be the moſt faithful to him: The great Conſtraint they live under, puts violent deſires in them to enjoy ſome freedom; and their very Amorous Nature makes them Witty to find out means to bring about their Deſigns.</p>
               <p>'Tis an unpleaſant thing to ſee the <hi>Diſciplinarians:</hi> The firſt time I met one of them I thought I ſhould have ſwooned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The unexpectedneſs of ſuch a terrible ſight ſeized me; fancy a Man coming ſo near you, that he'll cover you all over with his Blood; this, it ſeems, is one of their Paſtimes: there are certain Rules by which to Diſcipline themſelves handſomly, and Maſters to teach the Art, juſt as to Dance and to Fence. They have a ſort of a Gown made of their <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Cloth very
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151523:83"/> fine, which comes down to their Shooes; it is laid in ſmall plights, and ſo prodigiouſly wide, that it contains at leaſt fifty Ells of Cloth. They wear upon their Heads a Cap three times higher than a Sugar-loaf, and of the ſame ſhape: It is cover'd with Holland, and from it falls a great piece of Cloth which hides all the Face and the fore-part of the Body; there's two little holes in't to ſee through: On the back of their Waſtcoats they have two great holes upon their ſhoulders; they wear white Gloves and Shooes, and abundance of Ribbon which tyes their Waſtcoat-ſleeves, but hanging down, and not in knots. They alſo tye one to their Whip; commonly 'tis their Miſtreſs which Honours them with this Favour: And to be the more admired, they muſt not lift up their Arms, only the Wriſt and the Hand, and the blows muſt not follow haſtily, nor the Blood which runs out ſpoil their Cloaths. They give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt terrible cutes and ſlaſhes upon their ſhoulders, from whence runs ſtreams of Blood. They walk ſo ſoftly in the Streets as if they counted their ſteps; they preſent themſelves before their Miſtreſs's Window, and there with wonderful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience laſh themſelves. The Lady through the Lattice of her Chamber ſees this fine ſight, and by ſome ſign encourages her Gallant to Flea himſelf alive, and lets him know how very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe takes this Action of his. When they meet a handſom Woman, they whip themſelves after ſuch a rate, as to make the Blood flye upon her: This is eſteemed a particular Civility, and the Lady acknowledges and thanks them for it. When once they have begun to give themſelves this Diſcipline, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Health obliges them afterwards to uſe it every Year, otherwiſe they would be ſick. They have alſo little Needles ſtuck in Sponges, with which they prick their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and their ſides ſo eagerly, as if it did not hurt them. But I'll tell you ſomething yet ſtranger. Several Courtiers often take this Walk in the Night: But they are commonly the Young Fools, and they give notice to all their Friends of their Deſign, who immediately come to them very well Arm'd. The Marqueſs <hi>De Villa Hermoſa</hi> was one of them this Year, and the Duke <hi>De Vejar</hi> was the other. This Duke went out of his Houſe about Nine a Clock at Night, he had a hundred Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys of white Wax carry'd before him, two by two. Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore of his Friends went before, and a hundred follow'd after him, and every one had his Page and Footmen; and it was a very long Proceſſion. It is known when Men of this Quality are to walk; ſo that all the Ladies are in their Windows, and hang out their Carpets in their Balconies; and that they may
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:151523:83"/> the better ſee and be ſeen, they have Flamboys faſtned to the ſides. The <hi>Knight of Diſcipline</hi> with his Guard, paſſes along, and ſalutes the Spectators. But that which often cauſes a great deal of Miſchief, is, when the other <hi>Diſciplinarian,</hi> who ſtands upon his Honour and Reputation, marches with his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the ſame Street. This happen'd to theſe Perſons I have now mentioned. Each of them would have the upper hand, and neither would yield it. The Footmen with their Flamboys began to lay one another over the Faces, and burn their Whiskers and Hair; the Friends of each Party drew their Swords againſt one another. Our two <hi>Heroes,</hi> who were only Arm'd with this Inſtrument of Penance, ſearch for each other, and being met, being a moſt terrible Battel. After they have us'd a little Diſcipline about one anothers Ears, and cover'd the Ground with the ends of their Whip-cords, they fall to down-right Fifty-cuffs like any Porters: Though after all, there's but little matter to laugh at in this piece of Mummery, for they beat one another well-favouredly; they wound, and often kill; and here old Enmities revive and are reveng'd. But at laſt, the Duke <hi>de Vejar</hi> yielded to the Marqueſs <hi>De Villa Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa;</hi> they gather'd up their broken Whips, and mended them as well as they could: The great Cap, which was thrown into the <hi>Canal,</hi> was wip'd and put upon the <hi>Penitent</hi>'s Head again; the wounded were carried home, and the Proceſſion began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and they walk'd more gravely than ever, through a great part of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> had a great mind the next Morning to be reveng'd; but the <hi>King</hi> commanded both him and the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> not to ſtir out of their Houſes. But to come to what they do upon theſe Occaſions: You muſt know, that after theſe Servants of <hi>God</hi> are return'd home, there's a magnificent Supper prepar'd of all ſorts of Meats; and obſerve that this is on the laſt day of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-Week:</hi> But after ſo good a Work, they think they may do a little Evil. Immediately the <hi>Penitent</hi> cauſes his ſhoulders to be a long time rub'd with Sponges dipt in Vinegar and Salt, leſt there ſhould remain any bruiſed Blood; after that, he ſets himſelf at the Table with his Friends, and receives from them the Elogies and Applauſes which he believes he has merited. Every one in his turn, tells him, that in the Memory of Man, none was ever ſeen to to receive the Diſcipline with ſo good a grace. They magnifie all his Actions, but above all, the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that Lady for whoſe ſake all this Bravery was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. The whole Night is ſpent in ſuch kind of Diſcourſe, and ſometimes he that has been ſo well flog'd, is ſo ſick, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151523:84"/> he cannot go to <hi>Maſs</hi> on <hi>Eaſter-day.</hi> Do not think that I uſe any Art to ſet out the Hiſtory of this matter to make you merry, it is all literally true, and I tell you nothing, which you may not be ſatisfied in, from every body that has been at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are alſo true <hi>Penitents,</hi> which indeed troubles one extreamly to look on them; they are dreſt juſt as thoſe who gives themſelves the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> except that they are naked from the ſhoulders to the middle, and with a kind of a narrow Matt are ſwadled and bound ſo very hard, that all the Fleſh which appears is black and blew; their Arms ſtretch'd out, are wrapt about with the ſame Matt. They carry to the number of ſeven Swords ſticking in their Backs and Arms, which hurt them grievouſly when they ſtir too much, or happen to fall, which they often do; for they going bare-foot, and the ſtones in the Streets being ſharp, and cutting their Feet, they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly always keep themſelves up. There are others, who inſtead of theſe Swords carry Croſſes ſo very heavy, that they are even born down with them; neither would I have you think that theſe are of the ordinary People, ſome of them are of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Quality. They are forc'd to have ſeveral of their Servants to accompany them, but they are diſguiſed, and their Faces co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, leſt they ſhould be known. Theſe carry Wine, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and other things, to give their Maſter from time to time, who very frequently drop down dead with the extream pain and toil they endure. Generally theſe <hi>Penances</hi> are enjoyn'd by their Confeſſors, and they are ſo very ſevere, that he which undergoes them ſeldom out-lives the Year. The Pope's <hi>Nuncio</hi> told me, that he had forbid all <hi>Confeſſors</hi> to impoſe them; yet I have ſeen divers, though in likelihood it proceeded from their own Devotion.</p>
               <p>From the beginning of <hi>Paſſion-Week</hi> to <hi>Low-Sunday,</hi> one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtir out of Door without ſeeing an infinite number of <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> of all ſorts; and on <hi>Good-Friday</hi> they all come to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> which is but one general one for all the City, and is compoſed of all the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> and <hi>Convents.</hi> Upon this day, the Ladies are more finely dreſs'd than on their Wedding-days; they place themſelves in their Balconies, which are ſet out with rich Carpets and Cuſhions. Sometimes there's above a hundred Women together. The Proceſſion begins about four a Clock, and is not ended till paſt eight; for I cannot expreſs to you the numberleſs Number of People I have ſeen, counting from the <hi>King, Don John,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals, Embaſſadors,</hi> the <hi>Grandees,</hi> the <hi>Courtezans,</hi> to all ſorts of Folks, both of the Court and City. Every one holds a Wax-Candle in his Hand, and all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151523:84"/> which are numerous, carry Torches and Flamboys. In the <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> all their Banners and Croſſes are covered with Crape, and there's a vaſt number of Drums covered with the ſame, and they beat, as at the Death of a General. The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound ſome Melancholy Tune. The <hi>King</hi>'s Guards, which are four Companies of different Nations, to wit, <hi>Burgundians, Spaniards, Germans,</hi> and <hi>L'Ancillians,</hi> have their Arms covered with Mourning, and trail them upon the ground. There are certain Machines, ſet upon Theatres, which repreſent the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Life and Death of our Lord; the Figures are as big as Life, but very ill made and dreſt: There are ſome ſo heavy, that a hundred Men can but lift them, of which there's a vaſt number, for every Pariſh has ſome. I obſerv'd that of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> flying into <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſhe was upon an Aſs which had good Furniture; the Houſing was all over embroider'd with fine Pearls, the Figure was very great and heavy.</p>
               <p>Here they are afraid leſt ſometimes the People ſhould fail in their Devotion at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and therefore for that reaſon, each Pariſh-Prieſt goes to every Houſe, and enquires of the Maſter, how many Communicants he has? Being informed, he notes the Number in his Book: To every one that has receiv'd the Communion, they give a Printed Certificate. After <hi>Low-Sunday</hi> they viſit all the Houſes again, and demand to ſee the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, which they ought to have according to the firſt Account taken of them; and if they can ſhew none, there's a ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry made after him or her who has not Communicated. At this time the Poor who are ſick, hang out a Carpet at their Door, and the Sacrament is brought to them in a very fine and Devout Proceſſion.</p>
               <p>Since my being at <hi>Madrid,</hi> I have ſeen very few ſtately Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, except one for the Duke of <hi>Medina Celi</hi>'s Daughter. Her Coffin was made of rare <hi>Indian</hi> Wood, put into a blue Velvet Bag, and croſt with ſilver Mohair, with Cords of ſilver Thred, and the ſtrings were of the ſame, and faſtned the Bag at each end, like a ſtuff Cloak-bag. The Coffin was in a Hearſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with white Velvet, ſet round with Garlands and Coronets curiouſly made of Flowers. And thus they carried her to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi,</hi> the capital City of the Dutchy of that Name.</p>
               <p>Commonly they dreſs up the dead in the habit of ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Order,</hi> and carry them all bare-fac'd into the Church where they are to be bury'd. If it is a Woman, they put her on the habit of the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> This Order is in great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here; the Princeſſes of the Blood retire to their Convent. The Queens themſelves, when they are Widows, are oblig'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:151523:85"/> to ſpend the reſt of their Life there, unleſs the King otherwiſe appointed before his Death, as <hi>Philip</hi> IV. did in favour of Queen <hi>Mary Ann</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Wife. And in caſe a Queen is Divorced, ſhe muſt go into a <hi>Religious Houſe;</hi> for Divorced or Widow, ſhe has not the Liberty to marry again.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> preſume ſo much above other <hi>Kings,</hi> that they will not endure a <hi>Princeſs</hi> who has once been their Wife, ſhould ever be ſo to another, let her have the greateſt Paſſion in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don John</hi> hath a natural Daughter, a profeſs'd <hi>Carmelite</hi> at <hi>Madrid.</hi> She is wonderful handſom, and 'tis ſaid ſhe had no mind to take the Habit; but it was her fate, as 'tis of divers others of her Quality, who like it no more than ſhe.</p>
               <p>They call them the <hi>Deſcalcas Reales,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>The Royal bare-feet.</hi> This reaches even to the King's Miſtreſſes, whether they be unmarried or Widows, when he can love them no longer, they muſt turn <hi>Nunns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſeen ſome of the Works of St. <hi>Thereſa,</hi> writ with her own Hand; the Character is Legible, large, and indifferent fair. <hi>Donna Beatrix Carillo,</hi> who is her Neece's Neece, keeps them very choiſely. It was ſhe that ſhew'd them to me. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a Collection of Letters; I do not believe they were ever Printed; there's a great deal of Perfection in them; and throughout, one may diſcover a certain air of chearfulneſs and ſweetneſs of Nature, which ſufficiently declares the Character of that great Saint.</p>
               <p>All the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and even at other times, one meets with Preachers at every corner of a ſtreet, whoſe Sermons are ill enough contriv'd, and do as little good; but however in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching as they do, they both ſatisfie their zeal and their deſire. Their moſt conſtant Auditors are the blind Folks, which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our fingers upon <hi>Pont-Neuſ.</hi> Every one of them being led by a little Dog which does it very well, they go about ſinging of <hi>Romances</hi> and <hi>Cacara,</hi> which are certain old Stories or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Events, which the People are very glad to know. They have a little Drum, and a Flute, on which they play. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſing a Song on King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, it beginning, <hi>When the King left</hi> France, <hi>to his Sorrow he left it,</hi> &amp;c. Now I doubt you know it, dear Couſin, for who does not: This Song is ſung in very bad <hi>French,</hi> and by Folks that do not underſtand one word of it; All that they underſtand is, That the King was taken by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and as this Price was much for their Glory, ſo they are willing to convey the Memory of it down to Poſterity. There's a <hi>Flower-de-Luce</hi> all gilt upon the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:151523:85"/> roof of the Chamber where this King was Priſoner; and I muſt not omit telling you, that the Priſon is one of the faireſt Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in <hi>Madrid;</hi> the Windows are as large as thoſe of other Houſes. There are indeed Iron Bars, but they are all gilt, and ſet at a diſtance great enough, to make any one think they were not deſign'd to hinder eſcapes. I ſtood amaz'd at the ſeeming neatneſs of a Place which in reality is unpleaſant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and I thought that in <hi>Spain,</hi> they had a mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the <hi>French</hi> Proverb, which ſays, That, <hi>There's neither any handſome Priſon, nor ugly Love.</hi> Pardon this Proverb, I do not love them ſo well to trouble you often with them.</p>
               <p>All the Houſhold-ſtuff one ſees here, is extream rich, but not ſo neatly made as ours in <hi>France,</hi> and they come altogether ſhort of our skill. It conſiſts of Tapiſtry, Cabinets, Paintings, Looking-Glaſſes, and Plate. The <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Governours of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> have had moſt admirable Tapiſtry; the <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> ſhew moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Embroideries and Statues; thoſe of the <hi>Indies,</hi> Precious Stones, and Veſſels of Gold and Silver. So that ſeveral return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home from time to time, laden with the Riches of another Kingdom, cannot chuſe but to have enrich'd this City with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of valuable things.</p>
               <p>They change their Furniture ſeveral times a year; their Winter-beds are of Velvet trim'd with thick Galoons of Gold; but they are ſo low, and the Valens ſo deep, that one is as if they were bury'd in them; and when one is in Bed, the border of the Valens lying almoſt upon the Counterpain, one can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeen. In Summer they have neither Curtains, nor any thing elſe about the Bed; this looks very ill. Sometimes they hang colour'd Gauze to keep off the Gnats.</p>
               <p>In Winter they have their Appartments very high, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the fourth Story, according as the cold encreaſes, to keep them from it. At preſent they uſe their Summer Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are low and very commodious. All their Houſes have a great many Rooms on a floor; you go through a dozen or fifteen Parlours or Chambers one after another. Thoſe which are the worſt lodg'd have ſix or ſeven; the Rooms are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly longer than they are broad, the Floors and Seelings are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painted, nor gilt, they are made of Plaiſter quite plain, but ſo white that they dazle ones Eyes, for every year they are ſcrapt, and whited as the Walls, which look like Marble, they are ſo well poliſht. The Court to their Summer Appartments is made of certain matter, which after it has had ten Pails of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:151523:86"/> Water thrown upon it, yet is dry in half an hour after, and leaves a pleaſant coolneſs; ſo that in the Morning they water all, and a little while after, they ſpread Matts or Carpets made of very fine Ruſhes, which cover all the Pavement. The whole Appartments are hung with the ſame ſmall Matt about the depth of an Ell, to hinder the coldneſs of the Walls from hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe which lean againſt them. On the top of theſe Matts, there are hung Pictures and Looking-Glaſſes. The Cuſhions which are of Gold and Silver Brocado, are placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Carpet, and the Tables and Cabinets are very fine, and at little diſtances there are ſet Silver Caſes or Boxes, fill'd with Orange and Jeſſemin-Trees. In their Windows they ſet things made of Straw, to keep the Sun out, and in the Evenings they walk in their Gardens. There are ſeveral Houſes which have very fine ones, where you ſee Grotta's and Fountains in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, for they have great plenty of Water here, and 'tis very good. In the number of theſe fine Houſes they reckon, the Duke <hi>D'Oſſona</hi>'s, that of the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi>'s Lady, the Counteſs of <hi>Ognate,</hi> and the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> but I do wrong in particularizing of them, for there are a conſiderable number of them.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, it ſeems to me, that the great care they take, prevents the heats (let them be never ſo exceſſive) from being troubleſom to them. But do not fancy, I beſeech ye, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great Lords have their low Appartments, for indeed every body elſe has them according to their Ability; though it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little Cellar, they'll live in't very contentedly.</p>
               <p>There are but few ordinary People at <hi>Madrid,</hi> one ſeldom ſees any but Perſons of Quality, if ſeven or eight Streets which are full of Tradeſmen, are excepted. You ſee no Shops in this City, unleſs it be thoſe where Sweet-meats, Liquors, Ice, and Paſtry are ſold.</p>
               <p>I will not neglect telling you, that a thouſand People here, have their <hi>Canopys;</hi> for without reckoning the Princes and the Dukes, the <hi>Titled</hi> (of which there is a vaſt number) have theirs alſo. Theſe <hi>Titled,</hi> are thoſe they call the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the real <hi>Marquiſes,</hi> and the real <hi>Counts.</hi> If there be thirty Chambers on a floor in a Houſe, you ſhall there ſee as many <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopys.</hi> My Kinſwoman has twenty in her Houſe: The King has made her Marchioneſs of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> You cannot imagine how gravely I look under a <hi>Canopy,</hi> particularly when they bring me my Chocolate; for three or four Pages cloth'd in black like Lawyers, ſerve me upon Knee. This is a Cuſtom I had much
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151523:86"/> ado to bring my ſelf to, for methinks this reſpect ought to be paid to <hi>God</hi> only. But it is ſo common here, that if a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's Prentice ſhould preſent an old Shooe to his Maſter, he muſt do it with knee upon the Ground. This quality of <hi>Titulos</hi> gives them divers Priviledges, of which I have already told you, and particularly that of having a <hi>Canopy.</hi> They uſe no Balliſters about their Beds.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved to you before, Dear Couſin, that our Houſes are not near ſo well furniſh'd in <hi>France,</hi> as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality here are, but chiefly as to Veſſels of Silver, the difference is ſo very great, that one which had not ſeen it could hardly believe it: They uſe no Veſſel of Tin or Pewter, but either Silver or Earthen-ware only, is what they make uſe of; and you muſt know their Plates here, weigh little leſs than our Diſhes in <hi>France,</hi> every thing is made ſo ſtrangely heavy.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Alburqerque</hi> dy'd ſome time ago. I have been told, that they were ſix Weeks in weighing his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gold and Silver, and writing them down; during this time they employ'd two whole hours every day; this was very chargable. Amongſt other things, there were fourteen hundred dozen of Plates, five hundred great Diſhes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred little ones, and of every thing elſe proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably; there were alſo forty Silver Ladders to ſet things on the Cup-bord, which was made to aſcend by little Steps, like your Altars in a great Hall. When they told me of ſuch great Wealth of a particular Man, I thought they jeſted with me, and therefore deſir'd the Confirmation of it from <hi>Don Antonio de Toleda,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> who was in the ſame Houſe; he aſſur'd me it was very true, and that his Father, who did not eſteem himſelf rich in Veſſels of Silver, had three hundred dozen of Silver Plates, and eight hundred Diſhes. The mighty Meals which they make do not require ſuch great ſtore, unleſs it be at their Marriages, where every thing is magnificent. But that which cauſes ſuch great abundance of Veſſels, is, that they are brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> ready made, and pay no Cuſtom to the King. The truth is, they are little better ſhap'd than their pieces of four <hi>Piſtols,</hi> which they ſtamp in the Galeon as they come from that Country.</p>
               <p>It would grieve a body to ſee the ill management of ſome great Lords; there are divers which will never go to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, (for ſo they call their Lands, their Towns and Caſtles) but paſs all their Lives at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and truſt all to a Steward,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151523:87"/> who makes them believe what he judges moſt for his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. They will not ſo much as vouchſafe to enquire whether he ſpeaks true or falſe; this would be too exact, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence below them. This methinks is one conſiderable fault; the ſtrange profuſion of Veſſels only for an Egg and a Pigeon, is another.</p>
               <p>But it is not only in theſe things which they fail, but 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the daily Expences of their Houſes; they know not what it is to lay up ſtores, or make Proviſion of any thing, but every day they fetch in what they want, and all upon truſt, at the Bakers, Cooks, Butchers, and all other Trades; they are even ignorant what they ſet down in their Books, and they put down what price they will for every thing they ſell, this matter is neither examin'd into, nor contradicted. There are often fifty Horſes in a Stable, whithout either Corn or Straw, and they periſh with Hunger; and when the Maſter is in Bed, and ſhould be taken ill in the Night, he would be at a great loſs; for they let nothing remain in his Houſe, neither Wine nor Water, Charcoal nor Wax-candle, and in a word, nothing at all; for though they do not take in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſo near that there is nothing left, yet his Servants have a Cuſtom of carrying the overplus away to their own Lodgings, and the next day they furniſh themſelves with the ſame things again.</p>
               <p>They obſerve no better Rules with the Tradeſmen; a Man or Woman of Quality had rather dye, than to haggle for, or ask the price of a Stuff, or Lace, or any other thing, or to take the remainder of a piece of Gold; they rather chooſe to give it the Tradeſman for his pains of having ſold them that for ten Piſtols, which was not worth five. If there is a reaſonable price made, he that ſells to them is ſo honeſt not to take advantage of their eaſineſs to give whatever is askt them; and as they have Credit given them for ten years together without ever thinking of paying, ſo at laſt they find themſelves under great difficulties with their Debts.</p>
               <p>It is very rare they engage in tedious Suits at Law, or let things come to extremity; they bring themſelves to account, call their Creditors, and make over to them a certain part of their Lands, which for a limited time they enjoy. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they give up every thing, and reſerve only a Penſion for Life, which cannot be medl'd with by any Creditors who may afterwards ſell or lend any thing to them; and to the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151523:87"/> end they be not defrauded of it, they publiſh the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord and his Creditors.</p>
               <p>All Law-paper is mark'd, and coſts more than the other. There's a certain time when they make a diſtribution of Law-Suits; they give the Inſtructions at <hi>Madrid,</hi> but there are few judg'd there; all the Papers of one ſide are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bag, and thoſe of the other, into another Bag, and the Inſtructions into a third; and when the time to diſtribute the Law-Suits is come, they ſend them to ſome diſtant Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that very often one's Cauſe is try'd and judg'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing any thing of it: It is writ in a Regiſter whether the Cauſe was ſent, which is kept very ſecret. When Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given, it is ſent back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and is ſignify'd to the Parties. This Method ſaves a great deal of Trouble and Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, which in my Opinion ought always to be forbidden. As to buſineſs here, it is exceſſive tedious, whether it be at Court or in the City, and ruines one in a little time. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Practitioners are great Knaves in their Trade.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral different Councils, all compos'd of Perſons of Quality, and the greateſt part are Counſellors of the Sword. The firſt is the Council of State, the others are call'd the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Council of War, the Royal Council of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caides of Court, the Council of the Holy <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> the Council of Orders, the Sacred, Supream and Royal Council of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Royal Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Council of the Chamber of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the Council of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Council of the <hi>Finances,</hi> the Council of the <hi>Croiſado,</hi> the Council of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Court for the Duty of Horſe, the Court for his Majeſty's Woods, and the Courts of the Millions.</p>
               <p>They underſtand ſo little how to manage things to the beſt advantage, that when a Father dyes and leaves ready Money, and ſome Children under Age, that they lock the Money up in a Cheſt, and never put it out to be improv'd. For Example, The Duke <hi>de Frias,</hi> whoſe Widow is marry'd to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> left three Daughters, and ſix hundred thouſand Crowns in ready Money, they put it into three Cheſts, with with the Name of each Daughter. The Eldeſt was not ſeven years old; ſhe is now marry'd in <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Prince <hi>de Ligne.</hi> The Guardians conſtantly kept the Keys of theſe Cheſts, and never open'd that of the Eldeſt, but to compt it to her Husband. Obſerve what a loſs there is of Intereſt: But they tell you it would be much worſe, if the Principal happen'd to be loſt; that ſometimes when one thinks they have put it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:151523:88"/> out, it proves quite otherwiſe: That a Bankrupt makes one loſe all; ſo that it is better to gain nothing, than to hazard the Pupil's Eſtate.</p>
               <p>It is time to come to an end, Dear Couſin; I ſhall be afraid to tire you with a longer Letter: I beſeech you cauſe all thoſe I ſend you, to be deliver'd, and pardon the freedom I take; Adieu, I embrace and conſtantly love you with all my Heart.</p>

               <p>YOU did me a particular Kindneſs in letting me know that all my Letters come to your hands, for I was a little concern'd for the Two laſt: And ſince you ſtill deſire it, (dear Couſin) I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to inform you of every thing that paſſes, and of all that I obſerve in this Countrey.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Royal</hi> Palace is built upon a Hill which inſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the very Banks of the River call'd <hi>Manſanarez:</hi> It looks ſeveral ways upon the Country, which is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant there. One goes to it through the <hi>Callemayor,</hi> that is to ſay, the Great Street, which indeed is both very long and broad, ſeveral conſiderable Houſes add to its Beauty. There's a large open place before the <hi>Palace,</hi> no body of what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever, is allow'd to come with a Coach into the Court,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:151523:89"/> but they ſtop under the great Arch of the Porch, except it be when Bonefires are made there, or when there are <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querades,</hi> and then Coaches go in, a very ſmall number of Halbardeers ſtand at the Gate, upon my asking, why ſo great a King had ſo ſmall a Guard, why, Madam, ſays a <hi>Spaniard</hi> to me, <hi>Are not we all his Guards?</hi> He reigns too abſolutely in the Hearts of his Subjects, either to fear any thing, or diſtruſt them. The Palace ſtands at the end of the City towards the South, it is built of very white Stone, Two Pavillions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Front, the reſt is not regular. Behind it, there are two ſquare Courts, each conſiſting of four ſides, the firſt is adorn'd with two great Terraſs-walks, which run quite through, they are raiſ'd upon high Arches, and are beautified with Balliſters and Statues: That which I obſerv'd very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, was, that the Womens Statues had <hi>Red</hi> upon their Cheeks and Shoulders, you go through fine Porches which bring you to the Stair-caſe, which is extream large, the Apartments are furniſht with excellent Pictures, admirable Tapiſtry, moſt rare Statues, ſtately Houſhold Goods, and in a word, with every thing ſuitable to a <hi>Royal Palace.</hi> But there are divers of the Rooms dark, I ſaw ſome which had no Window, and receiv'd Light only when the Door open'd, thoſe which have Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are but little lighter, becauſe of their ſmallneſs, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Heat is ſo exceſſive, that they are willing to hinder the Sun from coming in, as much as they can. But there's yet another Reaſon, for Glaſs is very ſcarce and dear; and as to other Houſes, there are many which have Windows without any Glaſs; and when they would deſcribe a compleat Houſe, they'll tell you in one word, that <hi>'tis Glaz'd.</hi> This want of Glaſs does not appear without, becauſe of the Latices. The Palace is addorn d with divers gilt Balconies, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed look very fine. All the <hi>Councils</hi> ſit there, and when the <hi>King</hi> has a mind to be preſent, he paſſes through certain Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and little Entries unperceiv'd. There's a great many People perſwaded, that the Caſtle of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which <hi>Francis</hi> the Fifth caus'd to be built near the Wood of <hi>Bologn,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Model of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Palace; but 'tis a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and nothing is leſs alike. The Gardens are not ſuitable to the Dignity of the Place, they are neither large enough, nor ſo well improv'd as they ſhould be, the Ground as I have obſerv'd, reaches to the very Brink of <hi>Manſanarez,</hi> the whole is inclos'd with Walls; and if theſe Gardens have any Beauty, they owe it purely to Nature. They work hard to get the Young <hi>Queens</hi> Apartment ready for her Reception, all her
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:151523:89"/> Servants are nam'd, and the King expects her with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Impatience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Buen Retiro</hi> is a Royal Houſe near one of the Gates of the City, the Count Duke caus'd at firſt, a little houſe to be built there, and call'd it <hi>Galinera,</hi> it was for keeping his rare Poultry in, which had been preſented to him, and as he often went to ſee them, and the Scituation of the Place was on the deſcent of a little Hill, and there was a pleaſant Proſpect, ſo he was invited to undertake a conſiderable Building. Four great Apartments and four great Pavillions make a perfect Square. In the middle there's a Flower-Pot, well furniſh'd with Flowers, and a Fountain, whoſe Statue (which throws the Water when they have a mind) Sprinkles the Flowers and the Croſs-Walks, which goes from one Apartment to another. This Building has the fault of being too low, the Rooms are large, ſtately and adorn'd with curious Paintings. Every thing ſhines with Gold and lively Colours, with which the Cielings and Floors are beautified. I took notice in the great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, of the Entry of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Mother to the late Queen, ſhe's on Horſeback, with a Ruff and Fardingal, ſhe has a Hat trimm'd with Jewels and a Plume of Feathers; ſhe is fat, fair and pleaſing, ſhe has fine Eyes, and her Looks are ſweet and ingenious. The Room for acting Plays in, is well deſign'd, very large, all well ſet out, with Carving and Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there may be fifteen in a Box without inconvenience to each other, they have all Latice Windows, and the King's is richly guilt, there's neither Galleries nor Amphitheatre, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body ſits upon Benches on the Floor. On the ſide of the Terraſs is the Statue of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. upon a Horſe of Braſs, this Piece is of great Value, thoſe that are curious pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in taking a draught of him. The Park is above a good League in compaſs, there are in it divers ſeparate Lodges, very pretty, and which have good Accomodation of room, there's a Canal which is ſupply'd with Water from Springs at a vaſt Charge, and another ſquare Place in which the King has little Gundoloes painted and gilt, thither he goes during the great Heats of the Summer, the Fountains, Trees and Meadows making that Place more cool and pleaſant than any other, there's Grottos, Cataracts, Ponds, Shades, and in ſome parts even ſomething of the wild Fields, which ſhews the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Countrey, and is extream delightful.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſa del Campo</hi> is for rural Affairs, it is not great, but its Scituation is fine, being upon the Bank of <hi>Manſanarez,</hi> the the Trees in't are high, and yield a Shade at all times. I ſpeak
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151523:90"/> of the Trees of this Country, becauſe one finds very few of them, there's Water in divers parts of it, particularly one Pond which is ſurrounded with great Oaks. The Statue of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. is in the Garden, this Place is a little neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected here, I ſaw Lions, Bears, Tigers and other wild Beaſts, which live very long in <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe the Climate is little different from that from which they come, many People go there to <hi>think,</hi> and the Ladies uſually chooſe this Place to walk in, becauſe 'tis leſs frequented than others. But to return to <hi>Manſanarez,</hi> this River does not run up to the City, at certain times, it is neither River, nor ſo much as a Brook, tho at other times it is ſo big and rapid, that it carries before it all that ſtands in its way, all the Summer People walk in it, there's ſo little water in't at this ſeaſon, that one can hardly wet ones foot, and yet in Winter, all on a ſudden, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows the adjacent Country, this is caus'd by the melting of the great Quantities of Snow which covers the Hills, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends into the <hi>Manſanarez</hi> in violent Torrents of Water, <hi>Philip</hi> the II. caus'd a Bridge to be built over it, which they call'd the <hi>Segovie Bridge,</hi> it is a very lofty one, and every way as fine as the <hi>Pont-neuf,</hi> over the River <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> when Strangers ſee it, they fall a laughing, they think it ridiculous to have caus'd ſuch a Bridge to be built, where there's no Water. Hereupon there was one ſaid wittily enough, <hi>he would adviſe 'em to ſell the Bridge, and buy ſome Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Florid</hi> is a moſt pleaſant Houſe, and its Gardens are infinitely delightful; there are in great numbers <hi>Italian</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues by the beſt Maſters: The Water there makes a pretty ſort of a murmur, which with the ſweet ſmell of the Flowers, (of which they have a Collection of the rareſt and beſt ſcent) is very charming. From thence we come to the <hi>Prado Nuevo,</hi> where there are ſeveral ſpouting Fountains, and Trees there are of an extraordinary height; this is a Walk, which though it be not even Ground, yet is not leſs agreeable; its deſcent is ſo eaſie, that one hardly perceives the unevenneſs of the Place.</p>
               <p>There is alſo the <hi>Carzuela,</hi> which affords nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary delights, and ſome cool Rooms, where the King comes and reſts himſelf after Hunting; but 'tis the Proſpect which yields the Pleaſure, and very fine things might be there made.</p>
               <p>That I may tell you of ſomething elſe beſides the Kings Houſes, you muſt know, dear Couſin, that on <hi>May-day,</hi> they reſort to a Place without the gate of <hi>Toleda.</hi> This is called
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151523:90"/> 
                  <hi>El Sotillo,</hi> and no body excuſe themſelves from going thither; to be ſure then I went, but it was more to ſee then be ſeen, thô my <hi>French</hi>-Dreſs made me very remarkable, and drew a great many Eyes upon me, The Women of great Quality ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go abroad to take the Air in their whole Life, except it be in the firſt year of their Marriage, I mean into publick Walks and Places; and then too, 'tis under the very noſes of their Husbands, the Wife at the lower, and the Husband at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Coach; the Curtains all open, and ſhe finely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd: but 'tis a rediculous thing to ſee theſe two Creatures ſit like Statues, looking at each other, and without ſpeaking a word in an hours time. There are certain days ſet apart for walking and taking the Air, all <hi>Madrid</hi> go abroad then; the King is ſeldom there, but except the King and a few Courtiers, no body elſe fail of going. That which makes it very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is, their long Traces, which take up a great compaſs of Ground, and occaſion the Horſes often to entangle. Several Ladies which are not of the higheſt Rank, reſort thither, but with their Curtains cloſe drawn; they only look through little Glaſſes which are faſtned into the ſides of the Coach: but at Night the Ladies of great Quality come <hi>Incognito;</hi> and when 'tis dark they pleaſe themſelves ſo far as to walk a foot: They wear white Mantles upon their Heads; theſe are a kind of a Hood made of Woolen ſtuff, which covers them all over; they Embroider them with black Silk: they are only the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Women, and ſuch as go upon ſome Intreague, which wear them; yet ſometimes, as I have ſaid, certain <hi>Court-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> will go in this Dreſs. The <hi>Cavallero's</hi> alſo alight and walk, and ſay ſome odd thing or other to them, but they meet with their match.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Berka,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Enyoy, told me, that t'other Night as he was at Supper, and his Windows (becauſe of the cold) being ſhut, ſomebody knock'd at the Lattice of his Hall, he ſent to ſee who it was; they found three Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in white Mantles, who deſired to have the Windows o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that they might ſee him. He ſent them word, that they would be more conveniently in the Hall: They came in all concealed, and placed themſelves in a corner, and ſo ſtood all the while he was at Table. He intreated them (but in vain) to ſit down and eat ſome Sweet-meats, but they would neither do one nor t'other; but after they had ſaid a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merry things to him, in which they abundantly ſhewed a ſtrange quickneſs of Wit, they went away. He diſcovered that theſe were the Dutcheſſes <hi>de Medina Celi, d' Oſſona</hi> and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151523:91"/> 
                  <hi>Ducada,</hi> having ſeen them at their own Houſes; for <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adors</hi> have the priviledge ſometimes to go to the great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to give them a viſit of <hi>Audience;</hi> but he was willing to have yet a greater certainty, and therefore cauſed them to be follow'd: and they were ſeen to go into one of their Houſes by a falſe Door, at which ſome of their Women waited for them. Theſe little Diſguiſes are not always attended with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much Innocence.</p>
               <p>As to the Men, when Night comes, they walk a foot in the <hi>Prado;</hi> they make up to the Coaches in which they ſee Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and leaning upon the Bouts, they either throw Flowers, or ſprinkle ſweet Water upon them; and when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they go into the Coach to them.</p>
               <p>But as to the meeting on <hi>May-day,</hi> It is certainly a great pleaſure to ſee the Citizens and the People how they ſit; ſome upon the young Corn, ſome upon the ſides of the <hi>Manſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> others playing at <hi>Ombre,</hi> and others either with their Wives, Children, Friends or Miſtreſſes, basking themſelves in the Sun; ſome are eating of a Sallad with Leeks and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and others, hard Eggs; and others Gamon of Bacon, and even <hi>Galinas de Loche,</hi> which are Sea-Hens, and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. They all drink Water like Ducks, and play either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guittar or Harp. The <hi>King</hi> came there with <hi>Don John,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> the Conſtable <hi>de Caſtile,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Paſtratie;</hi> I only ſaw his Coach of green Oil-cloth, drawn by ſix py'd Horſes, the fineſt in the World; and all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Gold-ſpangles, and knots of Roſe-coloured Ribbon: The Curtains of the Coach were of green Damask, with a fine gold Fringe, but ſo cloſe drawn, that one could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing but through the little Glaſſes on the ſides of the Coach. It is the Cuſtom, when the <hi>King</hi> paſſes by, to ſtand ſtill, and in reſpect, to draw the Curtains; but we, according to the <hi>French</hi> faſhion, let ours be open, and were ſatisfied in making a very low Bow. The <hi>King</hi> took notice of a Spaniel-bitch I had in my Arms, and which the Marchioneſs <hi>d' Alvi,</hi> who is a very pretty Lady, deſired me to carry to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady; and as I lov'd it mightily, ſhe ſent it to me very often. The <hi>King</hi> ſent the Count <hi>de los Arcos,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guards, to ask me for it; he came up to the Coach ſide on Horſe-back. I immediately gave it to him, and the Creature had the Honour to be made much of by his Majeſty, was mightily pleaſed with the little Bells about her Neck; and the Buckles upon her Ears. He had a Bitch which he lov'd extreamly, and he ſent to ask me if I would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:151523:91"/> that he ſhould keep mine for <hi>Daraza,</hi> which was the Name of his.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily imagine, Dear Couſin, what anſwer I made. He returned me the Spaniel, but without either her Collar or Buckles, and he order'd the Count <hi>de Los Arcos</hi> to give me a gold Box full of Paſtills, which he had about him, and deſired me to keep it. It is but of a ſmall value, but coming from ſuch a hand, I mightily eſteem it.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Don John,</hi> who is my Kinſwomans Friend, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this mark of the <hi>King</hi>'s bounty to me; for he knew of my being in <hi>Madrid,</hi> though I had not had the Honour yet to ſee him.</p>
               <p>Two days afterwards, as I was all alone in my apartment, buſie in painting a ſmall piece, I ſaw come in, a Man whom I knew not; but one, who by the air of his Face, I could eaſily judge to be of Quality: He told me, that not having met with my Kinſwoman, he was reſolved to tarry till ſhe came, for he had Letters to give her. After ſome little Diſcourſe, he gave occaſion to talk of <hi>Don John,</hi> and told me that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, that I frequently ſaw him. I reply'd, that indeed, ſince my arrival, this <hi>Prince</hi> came often to viſit my Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but he never ask'd for me. The reaſon of that perhaps, adds he, was, becauſe you were ſick that day. I was not ſick, reply'd I, and I ſhould have been very glad both to have ſeen and heard him, for I have been told both good and ill of him, and I have a mind to know whether they do him right or wrong. I have ſignify'd my deſire to my Kinſwoman, but ſhe told me, there was no way to gratifie me, for he was ſo devout, that he would ſpeak to no Woman. It is poſſible, ſays he, in ſmiling, that his Devotion ſhould ſo much diſturb his Mind? for my part, I am confident he ask'd for you, and was aſſur'd that you were ill of a Feaver; Of a Feaver! cry'd I, that's very ſtrange! I beſeech ye, how do you know it? But juſt then, my Kinſwoman came in, ſhe was extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to find <hi>Don John</hi> with me, and ſo was I, for I little thought it was he. He told her ſeveral times, that he knew not how to pardon her for the Idea ſhe had given me of him, that he was no Bigot, and that he was perſuaded, true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not make a Man rude and inhumane,</p>
               <p>I think him very handſome, of a noble Carriage, very well bread, and extream witty, and of a mighty quickneſs of Mind. As my Kinſwoman has a great ſhare of Wit, ſo ſhe clear'd her ſelf well enough from what he taxt her with. But when he was gone, ſhe was ready to eat me for anger, becauſe I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:151523:92"/> deny'd having had a Feaver. I deſir'd her to excuſe me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe me, becauſe I was ignorant what ſhe had ſaid to him, and that I could not <hi>divine:</hi> She anſwer'd me, that at Court, one muſt either be able to <hi>divine,</hi> or elſe they would act a very ſilly part.</p>
               <p>She ask'd the Prince, if it was true, that the <hi>Queen</hi>-Mother had writ to the <hi>King,</hi> and beg'd that ſhe might ſee him, and that he had refus'd her. He agreed it was, and alſo, that that was the only reaſon which hindred his Majeſty from going to <hi>Aranjus,</hi> leſt ſhe ſhould come to him there, contrary to the Prohibition for her not ſtiring out of <hi>Toleda.</hi> What, my <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid I, will not the <hi>King</hi> ſee the <hi>Queen</hi> his Mother? Say ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reply's he, that 'tis <hi>State-Policy</hi> which forbids <hi>Sovereigns to follow their Inclinations when they do not ſuit with the publick good.</hi> We have a conſtant Maxim in the <hi>Council of State,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to conſult the Spirit of <hi>Charles</hi> V. in all difficult Matters; we enquire what he would have done upon ſuch an occaſion, and that we endeavour to practice in our turn. For my part, I am of Opinion with a great many others, that he ought not to ſee his Mother, ſince it was fit for him to baniſh her; and the <hi>King</hi> himſelf is ſo fully perſwaded of this, that he anſwered her, it could not be. But it was not difficult for me to ſee, that <hi>Don John</hi> fitted the Genius of <hi>Charles</hi> V. to his own.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> is gone to <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> where I had the Honour to ſee him firſt, at a Play, for he open'd the Lattice of his Box to look at us in ours, becauſe we were dreſt after the <hi>French</hi> way. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Lady was dreſt after the ſame faſhion, and ſo handſome, that he told the Prince of <hi>Monteleon,</hi> he was mightily taken with us, only it was pitty that our Heads were not trim'd, and our Bodies clad after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> mode; that the more he look'd at the <hi>French</hi> Ladies Cloths, the more they diſpleas'd him, that the Mens did not ſo much offend him. The <hi>Opera</hi> of <hi>Alcinus</hi> was acted before him, but I gave little Attention to it, looking ſo earneſtly at the <hi>King,</hi> that I might be able to deſcribe him to you. I muſt tell you then, that his Complexion is delicate and fair, he has a broad Fore-head, his Eyes are fine and have a great deal of ſweetneſs in them; his Face is very long and narrow, his Lips like thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> are very thick, and his Mouth is wide, his Noſe is very much hawk't, his Chin is ſharp and turns up, he has a great Head of Hair, and fair, lank and put behind his Ears, his Stature is pretty high, ſtraight and ſlender, his Legs are ſmall, and almoſt all of a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151523:92"/> thickneſs: He is naturally very kind and good, he is inclin'd to Clemency and of the <hi>great variety of Council he has given him, he takes that which is moſt for the advantage of his People, for he loves them extreamly.</hi> He is not of a vindicative Spirit, he is ſober, liberal and pious; his Inclinations are Virtuous, he is of an even temper, and of eaſie acceſs: He hath not had all that Education which is requiſite to form the Mind, but yet he does not want any neither. I will now note ſome of his merry Humours which have been told me, and though they are of no great importance, yet it may ſtill be pleaſant to know them.</p>
               <p>It is not long ſince the Lady <hi>Conneſtable de Collonna,</hi> who is in a <hi>Religious Houſe</hi> at St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> got out of the <hi>Abbey,</hi> from whence ſhe had made ſeveral Eſcapes; the <hi>Nuns</hi> tyr'd with her proceeding, reſolv'd to admit her no more; and indeed the laſt time ſhe endeavour'd to get in, they plainly told her, that ſhe might either betake her ſelf to the World, or choſe ſome other place than their Houſe for a Retirement. She was extreamly offended at this refuſal, which by no means ſuited with a Perſon of her Quality and Merit. She got ſome of her Friends to apply themſelves to the <hi>King,</hi> and he ſent Orders to the <hi>Abbeſs</hi> to receive her in again. The <hi>Abbeſs</hi> and all the <hi>Nuns</hi> were obſtinate in their refuſal, ſaying that they would themſelves repreſent their Reaſons to his Majeſty, and in their Perſons go to him. When this Anſwer of the <hi>Nuns</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the <hi>King,</hi> he burſt out a laughing, and ſaid, It will be pretty ſport to ſee this <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Nuns,</hi> who will come along ſinging, <hi>Libera nos Domine de la Condeſtabile.</hi> But yet they did not go, and choſe rather to obey, which is always ſafeſt.</p>
               <p>Some days ago it rain'd and thunder'd moſt terribly; the <hi>King,</hi> who ſometimes pleaſes himſelf in playing little Tricks with his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> commanded the Marquis <hi>d' Aſtorgas</hi> to wait for him upon the Terras walk in the Palace. The good old man ſaid to him in ſmiling, <hi>Sir, will it be long before you come?</hi> Why do you ask, ſaid the <hi>King?</hi> that your Majeſty, reply'd he, may ſend a Coffin to put me in, for there's no likelyhood that I ſhould be able to contend with ſuch Weather as this. Go, go <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> ſays the <hi>King,</hi> I'll come to you. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi> went out, and without any Scruple, ſtept into his Coach and went directly home. Two hours afterwards, the <hi>King</hi> ſaid, <hi>for certain the good old Man is wet to the Skin, let him be call'd in,</hi> I <hi>have a mind to ſee him in ſuch a Condition.</hi> But they told the <hi>King</hi> that he did not expoſe himſelf at all,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:151523:93"/> upon which he ſaid, that he was not only old, but very wiſe.</p>
               <p>There was taken a little while ſince near the Palace diſguis'd in man's Clothes, one of the handſomeſt <hi>Miſſes</hi> of <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſhe had ſet upon her Gallant, of whom ſhe believ'd ſhe had cauſe to complain, he knowing her by her voice and the manner of handling her Sword, would not make uſe of his to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo far from it, that he opened his Waſt-coat, and gave her free leave to thruſt at him, thinking perhaps, that ſhe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not angry, or had not Courage enough to do it; but he deceiv'd himſelf, for with all her ſtrength ſhe made a Paſs at him, which made him drop down, ſhe no ſooner perceiv'd his Blood, but ſhe threw her ſelf upon the ground, and cri'd out moſt dreadfully, tore her Skin off her Face, and pull'd her Hair off her Head: the People which were got about her very well perceiv'd by her Looks, and her long Hair, that ſhe was a Woman, the Officers of Juſtice ſeiz'd her, and ſome <hi>Lords</hi> paſſing by at that time, ſeeing her, related to the <hi>King</hi> what had happen'd: He had a mind to ſpeak with her, ſhe was brought before him; Art thou ſhe, ſaid he, to her, that has wounded a Man near the Palace, Yes, <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwered ſhe, I was reſolv'd to be revenged of an ungrateful Man; he promis'd I ſhould have his Heart, and yet I am aſſur'd he gave it ſince to another. But why art thou ſo afflicted, repli'd he, ſince thou haſt got thy Revenge? Ah <hi>Sir,</hi> continued ſhe, in ſeeking my Revenge, I have puniſht my ſelf, I am now upon the brink of Deſpair, I beſeech your Majeſty to command them to put me to death, for I have deſerv d the ſevereſt Torment. The <hi>King</hi> took pity of her, and turning to thoſe about him, Well, really, ſaid he, I can hardly believe that there's in the World ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable a State, as to love and not be belov'd. Go, ſaid he, thou haſt more Love than Reaſon, But endeavour to be wiſer for the future, and do not abuſe that Liberty I reſtore to thee. And thus ſhe withdrew without being carri'd to the Place where they keep miſerable Wretches that have led ill Lives.</p>
               <p>All this that I have told you of the <hi>King</hi> has carri'd me from the <hi>Opera</hi> of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> the firſt time I ſaw it was, with ſo much wandring of Mind, that when I ſaw it again, it appear'd quite new to me, there was never ſeen more ſorry Machines, they made the <hi>Gods</hi> come down on Horſeback upon a Beam which reacht from one end of the Theater to the other; the Sun ſhin'd by the help of a douſen of oyl'd Paper Lanthorns, in each of which there was a Lamp: when <hi>Alcinous</hi> practis'd her Enchantments, and invok'd the <hi>Demons,</hi> they came conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151523:93"/> out of <hi>Hell</hi> by Ladders: <hi>Le Gratioſa,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Jack-pudding</hi> ſaid a thouſand Impertinences, the Singers had in different good voices, only they ſang too much in the Throat. Heretofore there was a Liberty for ſeveral ſorts of People to come into the great Room, but this Cuſtom is chang'd, and now there's only ſuffer'd to come in, the Great <hi>Lords,</hi> and at the moſt, the <hi>Tutulados</hi> and the <hi>Knights</hi> of the Three <hi>Military</hi> Orders. This Room is certainly a very fair one, it is all paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gilt; the Boxes, as I have already told you, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Barr'd with Lattices like thoſe we have at the <hi>Opera;</hi> but they reach from top to bottom, and look as if they were Chambers, that ſide where the <hi>King</hi> ſits is magnificent. As for the reſt, the fineſt Comedy in the World (I mean thoſe that are acted in the City) very often receives its Fate from the weak Fancy of ſome ignorant Wretch or other. But there is one particularly, and a Shoomaker, which decides the matter, and who hath gain'd ſuch an abſolute Authority ſo to do, that when the <hi>Poets</hi> have made their Plays, they go to him and as 'twere, ſue for his Approbation, they read to him their Plays, the Shoomaker with grave Looks thereupon, utters abundance of Nonſence, which nevertheleſs the poor <hi>Poet</hi> is forced to put up, after all, if he happens to be at the firſt Acting of it, every body has their Eye upon the Behaviour and Actions of this pitiful Fellow, the Young People of what Quality ſoever imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him. If he Yawns, they yawn, if he laughs ſo do they. In a word, ſometimes he grows angry or weary, and then takes a little whiſtle and falls a whiſtling, at the ſame time you ſhall hear a hundred whiſtles, which makes ſo ſhril a noiſe that 'tis enough to confound the heads of the Spectators. By this time our poor <hi>Poet</hi> is quite ruin'd, All his Study and Pains having been at the Mercy of a Block-head, according as he was in a good or bad humour.</p>
               <p>In this Play-houſe, there is a certain part of it, which is call'd <hi>La Caſuela,</hi> it is like the Amphitheater, all the Women that are not over-vertuous ſit there, and thither the great Lords go to talk with them, ſometimes they make ſuch a noiſe that they would outdo the Thunder, and they ſay things ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant, that they would make one die with laughing: for their Wit is free from all reſtraint of Decency. Beſides, they are inform'd of all things that happen in the Town; and if they had a merry Jeſt to break upon their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> they had rather be half hang'd then loſe it.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that the Women <hi>Players</hi> are ador'd in this Court, there's hardly any that is not the Miſtreſs of ſome great
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:151523:94"/> Perſon, and for whom ſeveral Duels have been fought, and a great many People kill'd. I do not know how charming their Diſcourſe may be, but I am ſure their Perſons are the uglieſt in the World, they are extravagantly expenſive, and ſooner muſt a whole Family periſh with Hunger and Thirſt, than one of thoſe beggerly <hi>Players</hi> ſhould want the leaſt Superfluity.</p>
               <p>We are now in a Seaſon that's troubleſome enough, for 'tis the Cuſtom here to put their Mules to Graſs, and every body almoſt walks a foot. At this time you can ſee nothing but Graſs brought from all parts, and the greateſt <hi>Lord</hi> hardly keeps two Mules to draw him, for this reaſon they often go on Horſeback.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Horſes which have been at the <hi>Bull-baitings</hi> and are good for theſe ſort of Sports, are dear, and much in requeſt. The King had a mind to divert himſelf, and ordered a <hi>Bull-Feaſt</hi> to be on the Twenty ſecond of this Month, I was very glad of it, for though I had heard much talk of them, I never ſaw any yet; and the young Count <hi>De Coniſmark,</hi> who is a <hi>Swede,</hi> would <hi>Tauriſe,</hi> or Bait the Bull for a young Lady of my Acquaintance, ſo that I was the more eager to go to the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca-Mayor,</hi> where my Kinſwoman, as ſhe was a <hi>Tutulada</hi> of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> had her Balcony ſet up with a <hi>Canopy,</hi> a Carpet and Cuſhion of State. To give you a particular Account of all that paſſes at theſe <hi>Feaſts,</hi> I muſt tell you, that after the <hi>King</hi> has appointed one of them, there are ſome Cows, which they call <hi>Mandarines,</hi> led into the Forreſts and Mountains of <hi>Andalouſia.</hi> It is known that the moſt furious Bulls are in theſe Places, and as they are train'd up for this purpoſe, ſo they run into the Wood; the Bulls ſpy them out, and eagerly court them, thoſe fly and theſe purſue them, and ſo are decoy'd into certain Palliſadoes, ſet on purpoſe along the way, which is ſometimes Thirty or Forty Leagues in Length, ſeveral Men are armed with Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes and well mounted, hunt theſe Bulls and hinder them from coming back, but it is not ſeldom that they are forc'd to fight them within theſe Pales, and frequently they are kill'd or wounded.</p>
               <p>There are People placed all along the Road, which bring ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice when the <hi>Bulls</hi> will arrive at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and there alſo they ſet Palliſadoes in the Street to prevent any miſchief.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mandarines,</hi> who are real traitors, go conſtantly before, and the poor Bulls quietly follow after, into the very place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for baiting them, where there are great Stables built on purpoſe with Shutters contriv'd to keep them in, there are ſometimes 30, 40, or 50, Together, this Stable has two Doors,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151523:94"/> the <hi>Mandarines</hi> go in at one, and eſcape at the other; and when the Bulls think to follow them ſtill they are hindred by Trap, in which they are caught.</p>
               <p>After they have reſted a few hours, they are one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let out of the Stable into the great <hi>Place,</hi> where there are a great many young, luſty, ſtrong Peaſants, ſome of which take the Bull by the horns, and others by the tail, and becauſe they mark him upon the Buttock with a hot iron, and ſlit his ears, they call them <hi>Heradores.</hi> This is not ſo eaſily done, for there are frequently divers Perſons kill'd, and this is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Shew,</hi> which always mightily delights the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether it be upon the Account that Blood is ſhed, or elſe, that they love to ſee ſomething extraordinary, and at firſt ſight ſurprizing, and which afterwards furniſhes with matter for long Reflections; but though unlucky Accidents do happen at theſe Feaſts, yet it does not appear that they take any Warning from them, for they are ſtill forward to expoſe themſelves at at every Baiting that's made.</p>
               <p>The Bulls are fed, and the beſt of them are pickt out for the Baiting; they can even diſtinguiſh thoſe that are either Sons or Brothers of thoſe Bulls which made a great ſlaughter in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Feaſts,</hi> they tie to their horns a long Ribbon, and by the colour of that every body knows them again, and recites the Hiſtory of their Anceſtors; that the Grandſire or great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of theſe Bulls bravely kill'd ſuch and ſuch a one, and they expect no leſs from thoſe that then appear.</p>
               <p>When they have ſufficiently reſted, the <hi>Placa Mayor</hi> is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Sand, and round it are placed Bars as high as a Man, upon which are painted the Arms of the <hi>King</hi> and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. I fancy this <hi>Place</hi> to be larger than the <hi>Place Royal</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> it is longer than it is broad, and about it are Houſes built upon Pillars and Arches, like Towers, five Stories high, and to each a row of Balconies, into which there are great Glaſs-doors. The <hi>King</hi>'s ſtands more forward than the reſt, is more ſpacious, and all gilt. It is in the middle of one of the ſides, with a Canopy over it; over againſt it are the <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours</hi> Balconies, who have place when the <hi>King</hi> goes to Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that is the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Ambaſſadours, that of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and that of <hi>Savoy;</hi> thoſe of <hi>England, Holland, Swedland, Denmark</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes, have none there. The Councils of <hi>Caſtille, Arragon,</hi> the <hi>Inquiſiton, Italy, Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> the <hi>Orders, War,</hi> the <hi>Croiſado,</hi> and of the <hi>Finances,</hi> are on the right hand of the <hi>King:</hi> they are diſtinguiſht by their Arms upon their Crimſon Velvet
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151523:95"/> Carpets which are all embroider'd with Gold. After theſe, are placed the city Companies, the Judges, the <hi>Grandees</hi> and <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodos,</hi> according to their ſeverall Degrees, and at the <hi>King's</hi> Charge, or elſe at the City's, who hire theſe Balconies of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons that dwell there.</p>
               <p>For all thoſe I have now nam'd the <hi>King</hi> makes a Collation; and it is given in very neat Baskets, to the Women as well as the Men, it conſiſts of Fruits dri'd, Sweet-meats, and Water cool'd with Ice, of Gloves, Ribbons, Fans, Paſtiles, Silk-ſtockings, and Garters, inſomuch that theſe Feaſts always coſt above a hundred thouſand Crowns, and this Expence is defray'd out of the Fines and Forfeitures adjudg'd to the <hi>King,</hi> or to the City, this is a Fund which muſt not be medl'd with, tho t'were to ſave the Kingdom from the greateſt Danger, the doing of it might cauſe a Sedition. So bewitcht are the People with this kind of Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>From the Level of the Pavement to the firſt Balcony, there are Scaffolds made for the reſt of the People, they give from Fifteen to twenty Piſtols for a Balcony; and there is not any but what are lett, and adorn'd with rich Carpets, and fine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopies. The People are not ſeated under the <hi>King's</hi> Balcony, that Place is fill'd with his Guards, there's only Three Gates open into it, through which the Perſons of Quality paſs in their richeſt Coaches, and particularly the <hi>Ambaſſadors;</hi> and they make ſeveral turns round it, a little before the <hi>King</hi> comes. The <hi>Cavaliers</hi> ſalute the Ladies who ſtand in the Balconies, without being cover'd with their Mantles or Vails, they are deck'd out with all their Jewels, and whatever they have that is fineſt. One can ſee nothing but extream rich Stuffs, with Tapiſtry, Cuſhions and Carpets, all of rais'd work in Gold. I never ſaw any thing more glorious, the <hi>King</hi>'s Balcony is hung round with Green and Gold Curtains, which he draws when he will not be ſeen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> came about four a clock, and immediately all the Coaches went out of the Place. Generally the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> is the moſt taken notice of, becauſe he and all his Train are dreſs'd after the <hi>French</hi> mode; and he is the only <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> that has this Priviledge here, for the others are in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Dreſs. There's five or ſix Coaches go before the <hi>King's,</hi> in which are the Officers, the Gentlemen and Pages of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Coach of Honour, in which there goes no body, marches immediatly before his Majeſty's own, whoſe Coachman and Poſtilion are always barehead, a Footman carrying their Hats; the Coach is ſurrounded with Foot-Guards. Thoſe which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151523:95"/> they call the Life-Guard have Partiſans, and march very near the Coach, and next the Boots go a great many of the <hi>King's</hi> Pages, cloath'd in Black, and without Swords, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mark to know them from other Pages. As the Ladies that are deſign'd to be about the young <hi>Queen,</hi> are already nam'd, ſo they all came under the Conduct of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> in the <hi>King's</hi> Coaches, they march by the Mens Boutes of the higheſt Quality, ſome on Foot that they might be nearer, others mounted on the fineſt Horſes in the World, train'd up for that purpoſe, and which they call <hi>Horſes of Motion.</hi> That they may perform this piece of Gallantry, they muſt have leave from their Miſtreſſes, otherwiſe 'tis a great Blemiſh to their Reputation, and even engages the Ladies Kindred in Trouble, for they take their Honour to be concern'd in this Liberty: But when ſhe approves of it, they may practiſe all the pleaſant Humours, for which theſe ſort of <hi>Feaſts</hi> miniſter occaſion. But though they need fear nothing from the Ladies they ſerve, nor their Relations, yet they are not freed from all uneaſineſs, for the <hi>Duegno</hi>'s or Women of Honour, of which there's too great a Proviſion in each Coach, and the <hi>Guardadamas</hi> which go on Horſeback, are troubleſome Obſervers, hardly can one begin to diſcourſe, but theſe old Haggs will draw the Curtain, and the <hi>Guardadamas</hi> will tell you, that that Love which is fulleſt of Reſpect is the moſt diſcreet, ſo that very often one muſt be content to let the Eyes ſpeak, and to ſigh ſo loud, that one may be heard at a Diſtance.</p>
               <p>All things being thus diſpos'd, the Captains of the Guards and the other Officers mounted upon very fine Horſes, enter the Place, at the head of the <hi>Spaniſh, German,</hi> and <hi>Burgundian</hi> Guards, they are cloath'd in Yellow Velvet or Sattin, which is the Livery of the <hi>King,</hi> trim'd with tufted crimſon Galoon mixt with Gold and Silver. The Yeomen of the Guard, which I call the Life-Guard, wear only a ſhort Cloak of the ſame Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, over black Cloaths. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> wear Breeches tuckt up after the old way. The <hi>Germans,</hi> which are called <hi>Tudeſques,</hi> wear them like the <hi>Switzers,</hi> they ſtand in Ranks near the <hi>King's</hi> Balcony, while the two Captains and the two Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, who carry each of them a Staff of command in their Hands, and are follow'd by a great many in Liveries, march all four in a Rank, at the head of the Guards, ſeveral times round the Place, to give the neceſſary Orders, and to ſalute the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their Acquaintance; their Horſes curvet and bound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, they are covered with knots of Ribbons, and embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Houſings; they are called <hi>Piſſadoyes</hi> for Diſtinction. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:151523:96"/> this day every one of theſe <hi>Lords</hi> affect to wear that colour which their Miſtreſſes love moſt.</p>
               <p>When the People are come without the Bars, and are ſeated upon their Scaffolds, the <hi>Place</hi> is water'd with forty or fifty Tuns of Water which is brought thither in little Carts. Then the Captains of the Guards come back, and take their Poſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>King's</hi> Balcony, where all the Guards are likewiſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and make a ſort of a Fence, ſtanding very cloſe together; and although the Bulls are ſometimes ready to kill them, yet they muſt not go back nor ſtir from their place; they only preſent to them the Point of their Halberds, and ſo with a great deal of hazard defend themſelves.</p>
               <p>I do aſſure you that this ſtrange number of People, (for every place is full, even the tops of the Houſes as well as the reſt) the Balconies ſo richly ſet out, and ſo many beautiful Women in them, this great Court, the Guards, and in a word, the whole place makes one of the fineſt ſhews that ever I ſaw.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Guards are poſſeſs'd of the quarter where the <hi>King</hi> is, ſix <hi>Alguazils,</hi> or City Door-keepers, enter the place, each holding a white Rod: Their Horſes are excellent, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſs'd after the <hi>Moriſco</hi> faſhion, and cover'd with little Bells. Their Habit is black, they wear Plumes of Feathers, and put the beſt Looks on they can, in ſo much danger as they are in; for they are not allow'd to ſtir out of the <hi>Liſt:</hi> and 'tis their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fetch the <hi>Knights</hi> that are to fight.</p>
               <p>I ſhould tell you, before I proceed any further in this ſhort Deſcription, that there are certain Laws eſtabliſh'd for this ſort of <hi>Baiting,</hi> which are call'd <hi>Duelo,</hi> that is, <hi>Duel,</hi> becauſe one Knights aſſault the <hi>Bull,</hi> and fights him in ſingle Combat. Theſe are ſome of the things which are obſerved: One muſt be a Gentleman born, and known for ſuch, that he may fight on Horſeback. It is not allow'd to draw the Sword upon the Bull, unleſs he has inſulted over you; they call it inſulting when the Bull breaks or forces the Garrochion or Lance out of the Hand, or if he make your Hat fall off, or your Cloak, or has wounded you or your Horſe, or any of your Company. In this caſe, the <hi>Knight</hi> is oblig'd to puſh his Horſe directly upon the Bull; for this is an <hi>Empenno,</hi> that is to ſay, an affront that engages one to be reveng'd, or to dye; and he muſt give him <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na Cachilada,</hi> or a back ſtroke upon his Head or Neck. But if the Horſe on which the <hi>Cavallero</hi> rides, refuſes to go up to the Bull, then immediately he alights, and couragiouſly marches up a foot to this fierce Animal. The Sword is very ſhort, and about three fingers broad. The other <hi>Knights</hi> which are there
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:151523:96"/> to fight, are alſo oblig'd to alight off their Horſes and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, that is under the <hi>Empenno;</hi> but they do not ſecond him, ſo as to aſſiſt him in the leaſt againſt his Enemy. If they all march up in this manner towards the Bull, and he flies to the other end of the <hi>Place</hi> inſtead of tarrying for them, or meeting them, after they have purſu'd him ſome time, they have ſatisfied the Laws of <hi>Duelling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be in the Town any Horſes that have been at a <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and are dextrous at it, though they do not know the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet they'll borrow them; nay, though they do not deſire to ſell them, nor the others in a condition to buy them, yet they never refuſe them. If by miſchance the Horſe is killed, and they offer to pay for him, it is not accepted; becauſe, to receive Money upon ſuch an occaſion would not be agreeable to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generoſity. Nevertheleſs, it would vex a Man to have a Horſe that he had taken pains to breed up, without any more ado taken from him by the firſt Stranger, and through his means kill'd. This ſort of Combat is reckon'd ſo dangerous, that <hi>Indulgencies</hi> are expos'd in ſeveral Churches for thoſe days, becauſe of the great <hi>Maſſacre</hi> that is then made. Several <hi>Popes</hi> would have quite aboliſh'd ſuch barbarous ſights, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beg'd the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo earneſtly to let them continue, that their Humour has been comply'd with, and to this day they are tolerated.</p>
               <p>The firſt day I was there, the <hi>Alguazils</hi> came to the Gate, which is at the end of the <hi>Liſt,</hi> to fetch the ſix <hi>Knights</hi> (of whom the Count <hi>de Connismark</hi> was one) which offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Combat. Their Horſes are handſome to admiration and moſt richly harnaſs'd: Beſides thoſe they ride on, they had each of them a dozen led by Grooms, with as many Mules loaded with <hi>Rejones</hi> or <hi>Garochons,</hi> which are, as I have ſaid, Launces made of very dry Fir, about four or five foot long, painted and gilt, and the Iron-work very well poliſh'd; and the Mules were cover'd with Velvet Cloths of the ſame colour of the Combatants, with their Arms embroider'd in Gold: This is not practis'd at all <hi>Feaſts,</hi> when the City orders one, there's far leſs Magnificence; but as the <hi>King</hi> commanded this, and it was upon his Marriage, nothing was omitted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cavalleros</hi> were dreſt in black, embroider'd either with Gold and Silver, Silk or Bugles; they had white Plumes of Feathers ſpotted with ſeveral colours, and a rich knot of Diamonds, with a Hat-band of the ſame. They had Scarfs, ſome white, and others crimſon, blue and yellow, embroidered with Gold. Some wore them round their Waſt, others over their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:151523:97"/> like a Belt, and others about their Arm; theſe laſt were narrow and ſhort, without doubt their Miſtreſſes preſented them, for commonly they run to pleaſe them, and to ſhew that there's no danger to which they would not expoſe themſelves for their diverſion. They had alſo a black Cloak which wrapt them about, but the ends being thrown behind them, it did not hinder their Arms: they wore little white Buskins, with long guilt Spurs, which have only one ſharp point after the <hi>Moors</hi> faſhion; they alſo ſit a Horſe like them, which is called <hi>Cavalgas a la gineta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cavalleros</hi> were handſomly mounted, and lookt grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough for this Country; they were nobly born, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had forty Foot-men, ſome cloath'd in gold Mohair trim'd with Lace; others in Carnation-colour'd Brocado, ſtript with Gold and Silver, and the reſt in ſome other faſhion. Every one of them was dreſt like a Stranger, whether 'twas <hi>Turk, Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Moor, Indian,</hi> or wild People. Several of the Foot-men carried a bundle of theſe <hi>Garochons</hi> I have mentioned, and this lookt very well: Thus with all their Train they croſt the <hi>Plaza Mayor,</hi> conducted by the ſix <hi>Alguazils,</hi> and the Trumpets ſounding. They came before the <hi>King's</hi> Balcony, and made a profound Reverence to him, and deſired leave of him to fight the <hi>Bulls,</hi> which he granted them, and wiſht them Victory. Then the Trumpets every where began to ſound again, and this is done, as 'twere, in defiance of the Bulls. All the People fall a ſhouting, and repeat <hi>Viva, viva los bravos Cavalleros:</hi> After this they ſeparate, and ſalute the Ladies of their Acquaintance. All the Foot-men go out of the <hi>Liſt,</hi> except two for each Knight, which are left to carry their <hi>Rejoues;</hi> they keep cloſe to their Maſters, and 'tis very ſeldom that they forſake them.</p>
               <p>Several young Men enter into the place, and they come a great way off to fight on theſe days: Theſe I now ſpeak of are a foot, and not being nobly born, they uſe no Ceremonies with them. Whilſt one <hi>Cavallero</hi> is fighting, the reſt withdraw, but not out of the Bars; and they do not aſſault that Bull which another has undertaken to fight, unleſs he makes at them. The firſt to whom the Bull comes when they are altogether, is he that fights him. When he has wounded the <hi>Knight,</hi> they cry out, <hi>fileno es Empenno,</hi> that is to ſay, it is an Obligation upon ſuch an one to revenge the <hi>Affront</hi> he has received from the Bull; and indeed Honour engages him, either on Horſeback, or a foot, to attack the Bull, and give him a cut with his Sword, as I have ſaid, either upon his Head or Throat, without ſtriking him in any other part. Afterwards he may fight him
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:151523:97"/> as he will, and ſtrike him where he can; but in doing this, ones Life is a thouſand times in danger. When this blow is given, if the Knights are a foot, they may mount their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>When the King thought it was time to begin the <hi>Baiting,</hi> two <hi>Alguazils</hi> come under his Balcony, and he gives to <hi>Don John</hi> the Keys of the Stable where the Bulls are ſecur'd; for the King keeps the Key, and when it muſt be thrown, he delivers it into the hands of a <hi>Privado,</hi> or Chief Miniſter, as a Favour. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Trumpets ſound, the Timbrels and the Drums, the Fifes and the Haut-boys, the Flutes and Bagpipes make a noiſe round the Place one after another; and the <hi>Alguazils,</hi> who are naturally great Cowards, go trembling to open the Doors where the Bulls are kept. There was a Man hid behind the door, who ſhut it as faſt as he could, and then by a Ladder climb'd up to the top of the Stable; for 'tis uſual with the Bull, in coming out, to look behind the door, and to begin his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition by killing, if he can, the Man that ſtands there: after that he falls a running with all his might after the <hi>Alguazils,</hi> who ſpur their Horſes to ſave themſelves, for they are not allow'd to ſtand upon their defence, and their beſt play is to run away. Thoſe Men which are on foot, throw at him Arrows and very ſharp Darts, which are trim'd with Cutt-paper; theſe Darts ſtick in him in ſuch a manner, that the pain cauſing him to ſtir much, makes the Iron enter deeper; beſides, when he runs, the Paper makes a noiſe, and being on fire, vexes him extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; his Breath looks like a thick miſt about him, his Eyes and his Noſtrils are like fire, he runs ſwifter than a Race-horſe, and holds it much better; to ſpeak truth, he ſtrikes Terror. The Knight who is to fight him comes near him, takes a <hi>Rejon,</hi> holds it like a Ponyard, the Bull makes up to him, he declines his blow, and thruſts his <hi>Gorachon</hi> at him; the Bull ſo thruſts it back, that the Wood being weak, it breaks, immediately his Foot-men, who hold ten or twelve dozen, preſent him with another, which the <hi>Cavallero</hi> thruſts alſo into his Body; with this the Bull falls a bellowing, grows angry, runs, leaps, and woe be to them that ſtand in his way: And if at any time he is ready to run at a Man, a Cloak or a Hat is thrown at him, and this ſtops him; or elſe, one falls down on the Ground, and the Bull in running, paſſes over him. They have alſo great Figures made of Paſt-bords, with which they deceive him, and ſo gain time to eſcape. That which helps them further is, that the Bull conſtantly ſhuts his Eyes juſt before he puſhes with his Horns, and they are ſo quick in that moment to avoid the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:151523:98"/> blow; but yet this is not ſo certain, but that a great many periſh.</p>
               <p>I ſaw a <hi>Black,</hi> with a ſhort Poniard, go directly to the Bull, when he was in the height of his Fury, and between his Horns thruſt it into the very ſeam of his Skull, which is a place very ſoft and eaſie to be pierced, but withal, very ſmall to hit. This was one of the boldeſt and moſt dextrous blows that can be imagin'd. The Bull fell down dead upon the ſpot; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Trumpets ſounded, and ſeveral <hi>Spaniards</hi> ran with their Swords in their Hands, to cut in pieces the Beaſt that was no longer able to hurt them. When a Bull is kill'd, four <hi>Alguazils</hi> go out to fetch four Mules, which ſome Grooms, cloath'd in yellow, and Carnation-colour'd Satin, lead in. They are covered with Feathers and little ſilver Bells; they have ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Traces, with which they tye the Bull, and ſo draw him away; upon which the Trumpets and People make a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noiſe: There were twenty baited the firſt day. There came out a furious one which very dangerouſly wounded <hi>Count Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nismark</hi> in his Leg, and yet the force of the blow did not light upon him, but upon his Horſe, whom it burſt; he quickly got off him, and though he is no <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet he would not be excus'd from any of the Laws, It would have drawn pity from any body to ſee one of the fineſt Horſes in the World in ſuch a condition; he ran violently about the place, ſtriking fire with his feet, and kill'd a Man with a blow upon his Head and Breaſt: The great Rayle was open'd for him, and he went out. As for the <hi>Count,</hi> as ſoon as he was wounded, a very fine <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady, who believ'd that he fought for her ſake, ſtood forward in her Balcony, and with her Handkerchief made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſigns, in all likelihood to encourage him, but he did not ſeem to need being animated; and although he had loſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood, and was forc'd to lean upon one of his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who held him up, yet with great fierceneſs he advanc'd with his Sword in his Hand, made a ſhift to give a very great wound to the Bull on his Head; and then preſently turning himſelf towards that ſide where this young Lady, for whom he fought, was, he kiſs'd his Sword, and ſuffer'd himſelf to be carry'd away by his People half dead.</p>
               <p>But you muſt not think that theſe ſort of accidents interrupt the <hi>Feaſts,</hi> 'tis ſaid, that it will not end but by the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo that when any <hi>Knight</hi> is wounded, the others accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to the Bars, and immediately they return to fight. There was a <hi>Biſcanier</hi> ſo bold, as to throw himſelf off his Horſe upon the back of the Bull, held him by his Horns, and in ſpight of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:151523:98"/> all the endeavours of the Animal to throw him off, yet the <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canier</hi> ſet upon him for above a quarter of an hour, and broke one of his Horns. If the Bulls defend themſelves too long, and that the King would have others come out, (for freſh ones af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford more delight, becauſe every one has his particular manner of fighting) they turn looſe ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dogs; theſe are not ſo big as is generally ſeen there, but 'tis a breed ſomething like thoſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> carry'd into the <hi>Indies</hi> when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd them; they are ſmall and low, but ſo ſtrong, that when they once ſeize the Throat, you may ſooner cut them in pieces than make them let go their hold. They are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently kill'd, the Bull takes them upon his Horns, and toſſes them up in the Air like Foot-balls; ſometimes they hamſtring the Bull with certain Irons made croſs-wiſe, which they put at the end of a long Pole, and this they call <hi>Jaretar al toro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was another <hi>Cavallero</hi> under the <hi>Empenno,</hi> becauſe in fighting, his Hat fell off; he did not alight, but drew his Sword, and puſhing his Horſe upon the Bull which expected him, gave him a wound in the Neck; but as it was a ſlight one, ſo it ſerv'd only to enrage him the more: He tore up the Earth with his Feet, he roar'd, and he leapt about like a Stag. I cannot well deſcribe to you this Combat, nor the Acclamations of every body, the claping of hands, nor the multitude of Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs which are thrown up in the air, for an Expreſſion of Admiration, ſome crying out, <hi>Victor, Victor,</hi> and others <hi>Ha Toro, Ha Toro,</hi> the more to excite the Bulls fury. Neither can I tell you my particular diſturbance, and how my Heart fail'd me every time I ſaw theſe terrible Creatures ready to kill thoſe brave <hi>Cavallero's:</hi> theſe things are equally impoſſible to me.</p>
               <p>There was a <hi>Toledian,</hi> both young and handſome, which could not avoid being wounded by the horns of the Bull, who toſs'd him up very high, he immediately died; there were two others mortally wounded, and four Horſes either kill'd or deſperately hurt, and yet every body ſaid, it had not been a <hi>fine Baiting,</hi> becauſe there was ſo little Blood ſhed; and to have been ſuch, there ſhould have been at the leaſt, ten Men kill'd upon the Spot. It is hard to deſcribe the Dexterity of the <hi>Cavalleros</hi> in fighting, and that of the Horſes in avoiding the Bull. They'll turn ſometimes an hour about him, and tho they be not a foot diſtant from him, yet he is not able to touch them, but when he does hit them, he wounds them cruelly. The King threw Fifteen Piſtols to the <hi>Black</hi> that kill'd the Bull with his <hi>Ponyard,</hi> and he gave as much to one that had ſubdu'd another, and ſaid, he would remember the Knights that had fought.</p>

               <p>I obſerv'd a <hi>Caſtillian,</hi> who knew not how to defend himſelf, jump upon a Bull, as nimble as a bird. Theſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> are fine, great and magnificent; 'tis a noble Sight, and coſts abundance; One cannot give a juſt Deſcription of it, it muſt be ſeen to be well underſtood. But I aſſure you that all this did not pleaſe me; Do but think if a Man that is very dear to you, ſhould be ſo raſh to go and expoſe himſelf againſt a furious Beaſt, and that for your ſake, (for generally that's the Motive) you ſee him brought back weltering in his Blood, and half dead, is it poſſible I ſay, for you or any one, to approve of ſuch Actions and theſe Cuſtoms? Nay ſuppoſe one had no particular concern, would one deſire to be preſent at ſuch Sports, that coſt the Lives of ſo many Men? For my part, I wonder that in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where their King bears the name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> there ſhould be ſuch barbarous Diverſions permitted. I am ſatisfied that 'tis very ancient, becauſe they derive it from the <hi>Moors;</hi> but yet methinks this, as well as divers other Cuſtoms which they have from thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> ought to be entirely aboliſht.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> obſerving me very much diſturb'd and uneaſie during the <hi>Baiting,</hi> and taking notice, that I was ſometimes as pale as death, I was ſo much frighted to ſee ſome of thoſe kill'd which fought, ſaid to me in ſmiling, what would you have done Madam, if you had ſeen what had happen'd ſome years ago? A <hi>Cavallero</hi> of worth, paſſionately lov'd a young Woman, who was only a Jeweller's Daughter, but a perfect Beauty, and was to have a great Eſtate. This <hi>Cavallero</hi> having underſtood, that the moſt furious Bulls of the Mountains were taken, and thinking it would be a very glorious Action to vanquiſh them, reſolved to <hi>Taurize</hi> as they call it, and for that end deſired leave of his Miſtreſs. She was ſo ſurpriz'd at the bare propoſal only which he made, that ſhe ſwooned away, and by all that Power which he had given her over himſelf, ſhe charged him not to think of it, as he valued his Life. But in ſpite of this Charge he believed he could not give a more ample proof of his Love, and therefore privately, caus'd all things neceſſary to be got rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in order thereunto. But as induſtrious as he was to hide his deſign from his Miſtreſs, ſhe was informed of it, and uſed all means to diſſwade him from it. In fine, the day of this <hi>Feaſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he conjur'd her to be there, and told her, that her very preſence would be ſufficient to make him conquer, and to acquire a Glory, which would render him yet more worthy of her. Your Love, ſays ſhe, is more ambitious than 'tis kind, and mine is more kind than 'tis ambitious. Go where you think Glory calls you, you have a mind I ſhould be there, you will
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:151523:99"/> fight before me; well, I do aſſure you, that I will be there, but yet perhaps my preſence will afford you more matter of Trouble than Emulation. However he left her, and went to the <hi>Placa Mayor</hi> where there was already a mighty Aſſembly; but ſcarce had he begun to defend himſelf againſt the fierce Bull which aſſaulted him, when a Country Youth threw a dart at this Terrible Creature, which pierced him ſo deep, that it put him to a great deal of pain. He immediately left the <hi>Cavalero</hi> that was fighting him, and roaring ran directly after him that wounded him, this Youth thus frighted would have ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when his Cap which cover'd his head fell off, and then the lovelieſt and the longeſt hair which could be ſeen appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulders, and this diſcovered it to be a Maid of about Fifteen or ſixteen Years of Age. Fear had put her in ſuch a Trembling, that ſhe could neither run, nor any way avoid the Bull. He gave her a deſperate puſh on the ſide, at the ſame inſtant her Lover knew that it was ſhe, and was running to aſſiſt her. Good God! what a grief it was for him to ſee his dear Miſtreſs in this ſad Condition! Paſſion tranſported him, he no longer valued his Life, and grew more furious than the Bull, and performed things almoſt incredible. He was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded in divers places. On this Day, certainly the People, thought the <hi>Baiting fine,</hi> they carried theſe two unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Lovers to her unhappy Father's Houſe, they both deſired to be in the ſame Chamber, and though they had but a little time to live, yet beg'd the Favour they might be married, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they were married, and ſince they could not live together, yet at leaſt were they buried together, in one and the ſame Grave. The Story has mightily increaſed the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I had already conceived againſt theſe ſort of <hi>Feaſts,</hi> and I told <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> ſo, after I had thank'd him for his pains in relating it to me.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have ſaid nothing to you concerning the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language, in which I am endeavouring to make ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. It pleaſes me extreamly, it is expreſſive, noble, and grave, Love finds it commodious for its work, and can play the fool prettily enough in it. The Courtiers ſpeak more conciſely than others, they make uſe of ſuch abſtracted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons and Metaphors, that unleſs one is us'd to hear them, half their meaning is loſt. I have learnt ſeveral Languages, or at leaſt underſtand the firſt Rudiments of them, but yet in my mind, it is only our <hi>own</hi> which exceeds the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>

               <p>I come juſt now from ſeeing Ten <hi>Gallies</hi> which are arriv'd, this is ſomewhat ſtrange in a City that is Eighty Leagues from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:151523:100"/> the Sea, but theſe are Land-<hi>Gallies;</hi> for if there be Sea-horſes and Dogs, why not Land ones? They are ſhap'd like a Chariot, but four times longer, and have ſix Wheels, three on a ſide, and do not go much ſlower than a Chariot, the upper part is round, and is very like a Gally, they are covered with Canvas, and may contain forty Perſons; there one ſleeps and dreſſes victuals, indeed 'tis a Moving-houſe, they put eighteen or twenty Horſes to draw it, the Machine is ſo long that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turn'd but in a field; they come uſually from <hi>Gallicia</hi> and <hi>Manca,</hi> the country of the brave <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> they ſet out eight, ten or twelve in a Company, to be helpful to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in caſe of need; For when one overturns, it makes a great havock, and the beſt that can happen, is a broken Arm or Leg, there muſt be above a hundred to raiſe it up again. In it there is carried all ſorts of Proviſions, for the Country through which they paſs is ſo very barren, that on Mountains which are fourſcore Leagues broad, the biggeſt tree one meets with is a little wild Tyme, there's in't neither Inn nor Inn-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, you ſleep in the <hi>Gally,</hi> and 'tis a miſerable Country for Travellers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur Mollini</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi> conſecrated the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Indies</hi> on Trinity Sunday, and the <hi>King</hi> was there. I ſaw him come in, he had a Black Suit and a gold coloured Silk Belt on, and little Pearls were ſet round the flowers, his hat was ſo broad which they never cock here, that the Brims laid upon his ſhoulders, and lookt ill. I obſerved, that during the Ceremony he eat of ſomething which was held to him in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they told me it was either Leeks or Shallots, of which he eats very often. I was too far off, to ſee him well, he did not return to <hi>Buenretiro,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Corpus Chriſti-day,</hi> at which Ceremony he would aſſiſt. In coming out of the <hi>Church,</hi> I knew a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman whoſe Name is <hi>Juncas,</hi> he is of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> where I ſaw him, I ask'd him how long he had been here: he told me but a little while, and that his firſt Buſineſs had been to have ſeen me, had he not been engag'd at <hi>Bayon,</hi> not to loſe a minute's time, in the ſearch of a very wicked Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which was ſuppoſed to be hid at <hi>Madrid;</hi> That it was not the Curioſity to ſee the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Indies</hi> conſecrated, which drew him to the <hi>Hieronimites,</hi> (otherwiſe the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Conception</hi>) but that having deſired to ſpeak with one of the <hi>Nuns,</hi> he was told, that he could not ſee her till the <hi>King</hi> was gone. He added, that this was one of the handſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt Women in the World, and hath been the cauſe of a great unhappineſs in the Family of <hi>Monſieur De Lande.</hi> I remember
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:151523:100"/> to have ſeen her as I have gone by, and intreated him to tell me the matter. <hi>It is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>too long and melancholy a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to relate preſently; but if you will ſee the young</hi> Nun <hi>I ſpeak of, I am perſuaded ſhe'll not be unpleaſant to you.</hi> I willingly accepted his Offer, becauſe I have ſo often been told, that they have ſo much more wit in <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> then elſewhere in the world. We went into a Parlour, which had three ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Iron-doors with ſpikes, as made me wonder. How is this, ſaid I? It has been told me, that the <hi>Nuns</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are very amorous, but I cannot be perſuaded, that <hi>Love</hi> is bold enough to venture over theſe long Spikes, and through theſe little holes, where one muſt undoubtedly periſh. <hi>You are deceived,</hi> Madam, cri'd <hi>Juncas, at the Appearances of things; if the Lady which is coming, can ſpare me ſo much time, I'll pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tell you, what I learnt of a friend of mine a</hi> Spaniard, <hi>the firſt Journey I made hither.</hi> But at the very inſtant, <hi>Donna Iſidora</hi> came into the Parlour. I found her much handſomer, than I had fancy'd her in my own Mind to be. <hi>Monſieur De Juncas</hi> told her, that I was a <hi>French</hi> Lady which had a great mind to be acquainted with her, upon his report of her Merits. She thankt me in a very modeſt manner, and afterwards told us, that it was very true, that the Wretch after whom Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was made, had been lately at <hi>Madrid;</hi> but that ſhe was certain he was not now there, and that he had even had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to write to her by the hands of a Man where he lodg'd; that the Letter was brought to her after his Departure, and that ſhe would not receive it. It ſeems to me, ſaid I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of her, that he could not be taken, ſuppoſing he were yet here. Sometimes, ſays <hi>Donna Iſidora,</hi> Permiſſion is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from the <hi>King.</hi> There are certain Crimes for which there is no <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and that is one of them. She fell a weeping, notwithſtanding all her endeavours to hinder her tears, and added, that thanks be to Heaven, ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her ſelf with any thing in the late Buſineſs, but yet ſhe could not forbear grieving extreamly that ſhe had been the cauſe of it. We talk'd together a good while longer, and I was as much charm'd with her Wit as with her Beauty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I withdrew. I am abſolutly yours, moſt dear Couſin, be throughly perſuaded of it</p>

               <head>LETTER XI.</head>
               <p>ONE muſt love you as mightily as I do Dear Couſin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to write to you in a Seaſon when the Weather is ſo exceſſive hot: Whatever has been told me, and whatever I could imagine of it, is nothing in compariſon to what I now feel. To defend my ſelf from the heat, I leave open all my Windows all night long, without fearing the <hi>Gallick</hi> Winds which criple a body. I ſleep bare-head, I put my Hands and Feet in Snow, enough to kill one; but I think 'tis much at one to dye, as to be ſmother'd with heat, as they are here. 'Tis Mid-night before one feels the leaſt breath of Air from the Weſtern <hi>Briezes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In going to take the Air, one is ſufficiently puzled; for if the Glaſſes are open, one's chok'd with the Duſt, of which the Streets are ſo full that one can hardly ſee, and although the Windows of the Houſes are ſhut, the Duſt finds a way through and ſpoils all Houſhold Goods; ſo that what with the ugly ſmells in the Winter, and the duſt in the Summer, all things of Silver, and every thing elſe is ſo tarniſh'd and ſpoyl'd, that little can be kept handſom any conſiderable time: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all care at preſent, ones face will be cover'd with ſweat and duſt, like thoſe Wreſtlers which are repreſented to us in a Ring.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now tell you that I have ſeen the Ceremony on <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti-day,</hi> which is very ſolemnly kept here: There's a general <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of all the Pariſhes and Monaſteries, which are very numerous; the Streets thrô which the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> is to paſs, are hung with the richeſt Tapiſtry in the World; for I do not only ſpeak of that which belongs to the Crown which is there, but alſo of that which belongs to a thouſand particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons which have moſt admirable Tapiſtry. All the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conies are then without their Lattices adorn'd with Carpets, rich Cuſhions, and Canopies: they hang Ticking croſs the Streets to hinder the Sun from being troubleſom, and they throw water upon it, to make the Air cooler: All the Streets are ſpread with Sand, well water'd, and fill'd with ſo great a quantity of Flowers, that one can hardly tread upon any thing elſe. The Repoſitories are extraordinary large, and adorn'd with the greateſt ſplendor.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:151523:101"/>
               <p>No Women go in the <hi>Proceſſion:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was there in a black Lute-ſtring Taffety Suit, a Sholder-belt of blue Silk edg'd with white; his Sleeves were of white Taffety, embroider'd with Silk and Bugles; they were very long and open before: he had little Sleeves hanging down to his Waſte, his Cloak was wrapt about his Arm, and he had on his Collar of Gold and precious Stones, at which there hung a little ſheep in Diamonds: He had alſo Diamond Buckles at his Shooes and Garters, and a great Hat-band of the ſame, which ſhin'd like the Sun; he had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a knot which button'd up his Hatt, and at the bottom of that a Pearl which they call the <hi>Pereagrine,</hi> it is as big as the Ruſſet Pear, and of the ſame ſhape; it is pretended to be the fineſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that both its colour and kind is in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The whole <hi>Court</hi> without exception, follow'd the Holy Sacrament, the <hi>Councils</hi> walk'd after it without any Order or Precedency, as they happen'd to be, holding white Wax Candles in their hands; the <hi>King</hi> had one, and went foremoſt, next the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> where the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was. It is certainly one of the fineſt Ceremonies that can be ſeen. I obſerv'd that all the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber had a great gold Key by their ſides, it opens the <hi>King's</hi> Chamber, into which they can go when they will; it is as big as a Cellar-door Key: I there ſaw ſeveral <hi>Knights of Malta,</hi> who wore every one a <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Malta,</hi> made of <hi>Holland,</hi> and embroider'd upon their Cloaks; it was near two a Clock, and the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> was not yet gone in; when it paſt by the <hi>Palace,</hi> they fir'd ſeveral Rockets, and other Inventions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> went to meet the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> at St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, which is a Church near the Palace. Upon this day all the Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to wear their Summer Garments, they make their Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies very fine, in which they have either ſeveral Baskets of Flowers, or Bottles fill'd with ſweet Water, which they throw about whilſt the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> paſſes by; Commonly the three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies which guard the <hi>King,</hi> are new cloath'd. As ſoon as the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> is gone back to the Church, every body goes home to eat, that they may be at the <hi>Autos,</hi> which are certain kinds of Tragedies, upon <hi>Religious Subjects,</hi> and are od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough contriv'd and manag'd: They are acted either in the Court or Street of each Preſident of a <hi>Council,</hi> to whom it is due. The <hi>King</hi> goes thither, and all the Perſons of Quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Tickets over Night to go there; ſo that we were invited, and I was amaz'd to ſee them light up abundance of Flamboys, whilſt the Sun beat full upon the Comedians Heads, and melted the Wax like Butter; they acted the moſt impertinent piece
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:151523:102"/> that ever I ſaw in my days. This is the Subject of it:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knights</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi> are aſſembled, and our <hi>Lord</hi> comes and deſires them to receive him into their <hi>Order;</hi> there are divers of them that are very willing to it, but the <hi>Seniors</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the others, the wrong they ſhould do themſelves, if they ſhould admit into their Society, a Perſon of ignoble Birth, that St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> his Father was a poor Carpenter, and that the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> wrought at her Needle: Our <hi>Lord</hi> with great impatience expects their Reſolution, at laſt they determine with ſome unwillingneſs, to refuſe him; but at the ſame time propoſe an expedient, which is, to inſtitute on purpoſe for him, The <hi>Order de Chriſto,</hi> and with this every body is ſatisfied. This is the <hi>Order</hi> that is in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but yet theſe things are not done with a wicked deſign; no, they had rather dye than in the leaſt to fail of the reſpect due to <hi>Religion.</hi> Theſe <hi>Autos</hi> laſt for a Month; I am ſo weary of going to them, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelf as oft as I can: They uſe Sweetmeats and Water cool'd in Ice very much, and they have need of them, for the heat almoſt kill's one, and the duſt choaks a body: I was raviſh'd with Joy to meet <hi>Don Auguſtin Pacheco,</hi> and his Wife (of whom I have formerly told you) at the <hi>Preſident d' Hazienda</hi>'s Houſe; they come thither, becauſe they are related to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident:</hi> We were placed near one another, and when the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was over, we went to take the Air in the <hi>Prado,</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> Mode, that is Men and Women together in the ſame Coach. <hi>Don Frederick de Cardona</hi> was one; our Curtains were cloſe drawn whilſt there was a great many folks, becauſe of our beautiful and young <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women; but as we tarry'd later than others, the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and <hi>Frederick Cornaro</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, caus'd their Coaches to drive up to ours, and talk't with us; when all on a ſudden we ſaw a great <hi>Illumination</hi> all along the Walk, and at the ſame time appear'd ſixty <hi>Cardinals</hi> upon Mules, in their Habits and red Caps; after them follow'd the <hi>Pope,</hi> he was carry'd upon a certain Machine all cover'd with a foot Carpet; he ſat under a Canopy in a great Chair, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys laid upon a Cuſhion, with a Veſſel full of holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Orange-flowers, with which he ſprinkled every body. The ſhow march'd on gravely; and when they were come to the end of the <hi>Prado,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals</hi> began to play a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cunning tricks to make his <hi>Holineſs</hi> merry; ſome threw their Hats upon the Trees, and ſtanding directly under, they fell upon their Heads again; and others ſtood upright upon the Saddles on their Mules, and made 'em run as faſt as they could. There was a vaſt number of People follow'd them; we ask'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:151523:102"/> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuncio what this meant, and he aſſur'd us he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing of it; and that he did not like this ſort of Mirth. He ſent to enquire from whence the <hi>Holy Colledge</hi> came in that manner; and we underſtood it was the <hi>Bakers Holy-day,</hi> and that every year they us'd to make this fine ſhew. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> had a great mind to have diſturb'd them with a Volly of Cudgels, and had already commanded his Attendants to begin the Fray; but we interceded in the behalf of theſe poor People, who had no other intention than to celebrate the Feſtival of their <hi>Saint.</hi> In the mean time, ſome that had over-heard the Orders which were given, and were Diſturbers of the publick Peace, gave Information thereof to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals;</hi> this was enough to put all in confuſion, every one eſcap'd as well as he could, and their fear made our Pleaſure ſhort liv'd. In <hi>France</hi> ſuch <hi>Maſcarades</hi> would not be ſuffer'd, but perhaps there are many things innocent in one Country, which would not be ſo in another.</p>
               <p>My Kinſwoman knowing how very civily I had been receiv'd by <hi>Don Auguſtin Pacheco,</hi> invited him to Supper at her Houſe; I deſir'd him to remember his promiſe of giving me a Relation of what he knew of the <hi>Indies,</hi> immediately I'll tell you, ſays he, concerning thoſe they call the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in which a part of <hi>America</hi> is compris'd.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand King</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arrogon, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Columbus</hi> a <hi>Genoway,</hi> diſcover'd this part of the World in the Year 1492. As the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were the firſt that found this fortunate Country, unknown to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> ſo King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> had the Propriety of it by a Bull from Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. He eſtabliſh'd them and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>perpetual Vicars</hi> of the <hi>Holy See,</hi> over this vaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; ſo that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> are both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal Lords,</hi> and nominate <hi>Biſhops</hi> and other <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Tenths</hi> from them. Their power there, is of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than in <hi>Spain,</hi> for you muſt know that <hi>America</hi> alone is one of the four Parts of the World, and that we poſſeſs more Land there, than all other Nations together beſides. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the <hi>Indies</hi> which is eſtabliſh't at <hi>Madrid,</hi> is one of the moſt conſiderable of the Kingdom, and there being ſo great a neceſſity of holding a very frequent Correſpondence between <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> to ſend Orders to maintain the <hi>Court</hi> Authority, they were oblig'd to eſtabliſh beſide, a particular <hi>Chamber,</hi> which is compos'd of the eldeſt Counſellors of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and they are to take Cognizance of all things concerning the <hi>Revenues,</hi> and cauſe Expeditions by the Secretaries of the Council.</p>

               <p>Beſides this <hi>Chamber</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> there's another at <hi>Siville,</hi> call'd the Houſe of <hi>Contrataction,</hi> it is compos'd of ſeveral Counſellors both of the <hi>Robe</hi> and the <hi>Sword,</hi> with other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Officers.

               <p>It is the Council of <hi>Madrid</hi> which propoſes Subjects to the <hi>King</hi> to fill up the vacant <hi>Vice-Royalties</hi> of <hi>New-Spain</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> they are granted for five Years, and ſo are all other Places, of which the moſt conſiderable, are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> The Governour and Captain General, and Preſident of the Royal Chancellary of St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iſlands, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Captain General of the City of St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> of the <hi>Havana,</hi> the Governour and Captain of War, of the City of St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Cuba,</hi> the Governour and Captain General of the City of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Puerto Rigo,</hi> the Governour and Captain General of the City of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> the Governour of the City of <hi>Aſcention</hi> of the Iſland of <hi>Marguretta,</hi> the Governour and Captain General of the City of <hi>Cumana,</hi> Capital of <hi>New-Andalouſia,</hi> the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Captain General of <hi>New Spain,</hi> A Preſident of the <hi>Royal</hi> Audience, who reſides in the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Captain General of the City of <hi>Merida,</hi> Capital of the Province of <hi>Yucatan,</hi> the Preſident and Governour of the <hi>Royal</hi> Audience and Chancellery, which reſides in the City of <hi>Gaudalaxara,</hi> captital of the Kingdom of <hi>Galatia;</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Captain General of the City of <hi>Guadiana,</hi> capital of the Kingdom of <hi>New Biſcay;</hi> the Governour Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Preſident of the Chancellery which reſides in the City of <hi>Santiago,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Guatemela;</hi> the Goverour of the Province of <hi>Locnuſco</hi> in the Strait of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Captain General of the City of <hi>Cornagua,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Honduras,;</hi> the Governour of the City of St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Lyon,</hi> capital of the Province of <hi>Nicaragua;</hi> the Governour

               <p>I do not hear mention the Places of <hi>Judicature,</hi> nor the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,</hi> which are very numerous; But it muſt be obſerv'd, that all the Employments I have ſpoken of, are given either from three to three Years, or from five to five Years, that ſo one Man alone may not grow rich, whilſt there are ſo many others that ſtand in need to partake of the <hi>King</hi>'s Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Places where there is no <hi>Vice Roy,</hi> he that is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, is alſo Governour, and when a <hi>Vice Roy</hi> dies, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the <hi>Vice Royalty</hi> for the time being, takes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, till another <hi>Vice Roy</hi> is ſent from <hi>Spain.</hi> It is his <hi>Catholick</hi> Majeſty which gives thoſe great Poſts and the moſt conſiderable Governments. The <hi>Vice Roys</hi> fill up the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and theſe <hi>Vice Roys</hi> make a ſhift very eaſily in five Years time to bring home two Millions of Crowns all charges paid, the Governours of the Principal Places, get in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of time about five or ſix hundred thouſand Crowns; none goes thither, but what grows rich, and this is ſo certain, that even the <hi>Fryers</hi> which are ſent thither to preach the <hi>Faith,</hi> and convert the <hi>Indians,</hi> make ſuch a profitable <hi>Miſſion,</hi> that they bring home every one of them, thirty or forty thouſand Crowns. The <hi>King</hi> diſpoſes of divers Penſions paid by the <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages</hi> of the <hi>Indies.</hi> And from theſe they draw from two to ſix thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum.</hi> And this is another way the <hi>King</hi> has to gratifie his Subjects.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands which lie near the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> depend upon the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Trade there is in Silk: theſe Places coſt him more to keep, then they bring him in.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſtillians</hi> had their Reaſons why they would not let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort of <hi>Manufactures</hi> be ſet up in the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor any Stuffs made there, nor any of thoſe things elſe, which are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neceſſary. This Policy cauſe every thing to go from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and make the <hi>Indians,</hi> who paſſionately love all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and Ornaments which come from thence freely to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their Silver to their Satisfaction: by this means, they are put out of a Capacity to grow rich, becauſe they are forc'd at very dear rates to buy the leaſt Trifle they want, and with which they amuſe them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Flota</hi> conſiſts of divers Veſſels loden with rich Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes which are ſent to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and there are other great Ships of War which are call'd <hi>Galleons,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> ſends to convoy them. Theſe Men of War ought not to carry any Merchants Goods, but the Lucre of Gain tempts them againſt the expreſs Prohibition of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſometimes they are ſo
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:151523:104"/> full laden, that if they ſhould happen to be attack'd, they could not defend themſelves. When theſe Veſſels are ready to ſail, the Diſpatch which the Merchants obtain from the Council of the <hi>Indies</hi> at <hi>Madrid</hi> for leave to ſend them, coſt for each of them, from three to ſix thouſand Crowns, according to the bigneſs of the Veſſel. It is eaſie to imagine, that ſince they give ſo much, they are ſure of gaining a great deal more.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Galleons</hi> go no further then <hi>Porto Velo,</hi> whither they bring all the Silver of <hi>Peru,</hi> the <hi>Flota</hi> leaves them at this Place, and continue their Voyage to <hi>New Spain.</hi> The <hi>Galleons</hi> ſail from <hi>Sanlucar</hi> to <hi>Cartagene</hi> in ſix Weeks or two Months at moſt, they tarry there a little while, and in five or ſix Days they come back to <hi>Portovelo;</hi> it is a Town ſcituated on the Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> the Air there is very unwholſom, and the Weather exceſſive hot. On the other ſide of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> ſome ten Leagues diſtance only, is the City of <hi>Panama,</hi> whether is brought from <hi>Peru</hi> a vaſt Quantity of Silver in Bars or Wedges, and divers Merchandizes which are convey'd by Land-carriage to <hi>Porto velo,</hi> where the <hi>Galleons</hi> are, and where there is kept one of the greateſt Fairs in the World, for in leſs then forty or fifty Days there is ſold of all ſorts of <hi>European</hi> Goods to the value at leaſt of twenty Millions of Crowns ready Money. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fair is done, the <hi>Galleons</hi> return to <hi>Cartagena,</hi> at which place there's a conſiderable Trade for <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, and thoſe of the Kingdom of St. <hi>Foy,</hi> as well as for thoſe, from <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genta:</hi> After this, they go to the <hi>Havana</hi> to take in neceſſary Proviſions for this Voyage, and from thence they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Months in Sailing to <hi>Cadiz;</hi> But as to the <hi>Flotta,</hi> it ſtops at <hi>Porto Rico</hi> to refreſh, and arrives at <hi>Vera Crux</hi> in five Weeks, there they unload their Merchandizes, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carry'd by Land fourſcore Leagues beyond to the great City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Sale of them is quickly over, and the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> parts afterwards to go to the <hi>Havana;</hi> but this muſt be paſt only in the Month of <hi>April</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> becauſe of the North Winds. The <hi>Galleons</hi> are commonly Nine Months in their Voyage to <hi>Peru,</hi> and the <hi>Flota</hi> is thirteen or fourteen Months, ſome particular Perſons go thither alſo at their own Charge, after they have obtained Leave from the <hi>King</hi> and have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered themſelves at the <hi>Contrataction</hi> at <hi>Sevile,</hi> theſe go to the Coaſts of St. <hi>Domingo, Honduras, Caracas,</hi> and <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Money which comes directly from the <hi>King</hi> from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> muſt be brought in one <hi>Galleon,</hi> this Silver is deliver'd to one of the Maſters of the Mint, who pays to the <hi>King</hi> every Voyage he makes, ſix thouſand Crowns, and he keeps one <hi>per
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:151523:105"/> Cent.</hi> Of all the Silver that goes through his Hands, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes high. As to the Silver which belongs to particular Perſons, that is brought in what Veſſels they will chooſe; and it is the Captain that is reſponſible for it.</p>
               <p>There's a certain Duty which is Call'd <hi>Avarie,</hi> and it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for all Goods Regiſtred, and for all the Silver which is brought from the <hi>Indies.</hi> This Duty is ſo conſiderable, that it ſuffices to fit out the <hi>Galleons</hi> and the <hi>Flota</hi> for their Voyage, although the Charge amounts to nine Millions of Crowns; but that of the <hi>Flota</hi> is not ſo great.</p>
               <p>He that the <hi>King</hi> chooſes to be <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Galleons,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to him, fourſcore or a hundred thouſand Crowns which is repaid him in the <hi>Indies</hi> with great Intereſt. Every other <hi>Captain</hi> does alſo advance Money to the <hi>King</hi> proportionable to the bigneſs of the Veſſel they command. There goes more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with the <hi>Galleons</hi> a <hi>Patacha,</hi> which leaves them in the Gulph <hi>Delas Yequas,</hi> ſhe goes to the Iſles of <hi>Margueritta</hi> to fiſh for Pearles, of which they pay to the King a fifth part, that is of all the Pearl they take, and afterwards ſhe comes to <hi>Cartegena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within theſe few Years, there is diſcovered Seventy Leagues from <hi>Lima,</hi> ſome <hi>Mines</hi> which yield a vaſt Revenue, thoſe of <hi>Peru,</hi> and all the others in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> pay the <hi>King</hi> the fifth part, as well of the <hi>Gold,</hi> as the <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Emeraulds.</hi> There is at <hi>Potoſi</hi> greater plenty of <hi>Mines</hi> than any where elſe, the Silver they get there is brought to <hi>Port D' Ariga,</hi> and from thence, it is ſent to <hi>Callao.</hi> It is one of the Ports of <hi>Lima,</hi> whether the <hi>Galleons</hi> come to fetch it. The Kingdom of <hi>Peru</hi> yields every Year in Gold and Silver to the Value of eleven Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Crowns. From <hi>New Spain</hi> is brought five Millions of Crowns, beſides Marchandizes, which are commonly, Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aulds, Gold, Silver, Cochenil, Tobacco, Wool of <hi>Vigogne, Campecha</hi> Wood and Hydes.</p>
               <p>It was a long while before they would ſuffer in <hi>New Spain</hi> any Workmen that wrought in Silk or Wool; there are ſome now, and this may do ſome hurt to the Trade of Stuffs which are ſent from <hi>Europe,</hi> they are not allow'd to plant there any <hi>Olive</hi> Trees or <hi>Vines,</hi> that ſo the Oyl and Wine which is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither may ſell the better. The King has the Power in the <hi>Indies</hi> as well as <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſell the <hi>Bull</hi> of the <hi>Cruſada,</hi> which is a Licence to eat Fleſh every <hi>Saturday,</hi> and to enjoy the Benefit of <hi>Indulgences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Idolaters are not ſubject to the Inquiſition in the <hi>Indies;</hi> that it is eſtabliſh'd only againſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:151523:105"/> No Strangers are ſuffered to go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> but if at any time ſome happen to go, there muſt be a ſpecial Permiſſion obtain'd which is very rarely granted.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible for me, continued <hi>Don Auguſtine,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to you the Beautifulneſs of the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the Palaces, the Publick Places, the Riches, the Profuſion, the Magnificence and the Pleaſures, a City that is ſo happily ſcituated, that in all Seaſons it enjoys a continual Spring, and where the Heats are not at all exceſſive, where they feel not the Severity of Winter. the Country is no leſs charming, the Flowers and the Fruits at all times equally loading the Trees. There you gather more than one Crop in a Year; the Lakes and Ponds are full of Fiſh, the Grounds are well ſtockt with Cattel, the Foreſts and Woods afford excellent Fowl and wild Beaſts, the Earth ſeems to open her Bowels on purpoſe to give up the Gold ſhe encloſes, there are Mines or Rocks of precious Stones diſcover'd, and Pearl are there taken. Oh! ſaid I, let us all go dwell in that Country. This Deſcription Charms, but as 'tis a long Voyage, it may be convenient, if you pleaſe, Madam, ſaid I, to <hi>Donna Tereza</hi> in ſmiling, to get our Supper before we go; I immediately took her by the hand, and we came into a Parlour, where I had provided the beſt Muſicians, which are bad enough, and which in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have nothing to recommend them but their dearneſs. My Cook made us ſome <hi>Ragous</hi> afte the <hi>French</hi> way, which <hi>Donna Thereſa</hi> found ſo excellent, that ſhe deſir'd I would let her have the Receipt how to do them. <hi>Don Auguſtin</hi> intreated me alſo, to let him have ſome of my <hi>Larding-Pins,</hi> of which really one may look all over <hi>Spain,</hi> and not find ſo much as one. We tarry'd very late together, for in this Seaſon they ſet up till four or five a Clock in the Morning becauſe of the heats, and that the beſt time is in the Night.</p>
               <p>There are certain days in the year, that every body goes out to take the Air upon the Bridges which croſs the River <hi>Manſanarez;</hi> but at preſent all Coaches are laid up, the Gravel and ſome little Brooks help to make it very cool and pleaſant. The Horſes endure a great deal in theſe Walks, for nothing can be more prejudicial to their Feet than the Flints upon which they continually tread. In certain places of this River they make a ſtand, and there remain till two or three a Clock in the Morning; there is very often a thouſand Coaches: Some particular People bring Victuals to eat there, and others ſing and play upon ſeveral Inſtruments; all this is very pleaſant in a fine Night: There are ſome Perſons which waſh or bath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:151523:106"/> themſelves, but indeed 'tis after an ugly manner. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Lady did it lately; her People go a little before her, and dig a great hole in the Gravel, which preſently fills it ſelf with Water, into which the Lady comes and thruſts her ſelf; you may imagine how pleaſant ſuch a Bath is, and yet this is the only way that can be made uſe of in this River.</p>
               <p>You will not be ſorry, perhaps, to know, that in making out ones <hi>Nobility</hi> here, it muſt be prov'd, that one is deſcended both by Father and Mother from <hi>Vijos Chriſtianos,</hi> that is, from <hi>Ancient Chriſtians.</hi> The blemiſh which they ought to fear is, their being allay'd to any <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Family.</p>
               <p>As the People of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> were defended from the Invaſion of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> by the height and Ruggedneſs of their Mountains, ſo they eſteem themſelves all <hi>Cavalleros,</hi> even to the meaneſt Water-bearer; for in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Children ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take their Mothers Name, if ſhe's of a better Family than the Father. It is certain, that there are few Families en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and whoſe Name and <hi>Nobility</hi> has not been carry'd by an only Daughter and mixt with another Family: That of <hi>Velaſco</hi> is not of this number, for they reckon up ten <hi>Conneſtables</hi> of <hi>Caſtilo</hi> ſucceſſively from Father to Son. Here's one thing very ſingular, and that which is not allow'd of in any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that is, That <hi>Foundlings,</hi> or Children found by chance are reckon'd <hi>Noble,</hi> and bear the Title of <hi>Hidalgos,</hi> and enjoy all the Priviledges annext to the Nobility; but to this end, they muſt prove, that they were <hi>Foundlings,</hi> and were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and bred in the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> where ſuch Children are kept.</p>
               <p>There are in <hi>Spain</hi> ſome great Families which hold almoſt all their Eſtates by the Title of <hi>Mayorargo;</hi> and when it happens that all of the Name are dead, and that the next akin is a Male, though he be a natural Son, yet he ſhall Inherit; and for want of ſuch, the eldeſt Domeſtick ſhall take the Name and the Arms of his Maſter, and inherit his Eſtate: And this is one reaſon why the younger Brothers of other Houſes, as Noble and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, do not ſcorn to be Servants to theſe, and their hopes are pretty well grounded; for it often happens that Families are extinct, becauſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women have fewer Children than the Women of other Countries.</p>
               <p>There lately happen'd a very great misfortune to a young Woman of Quality called <hi>Donna Clora;</hi> ſhe could not preſerve her Heart againſt the Charms of <hi>Count de Caſtrillo,</hi> a Man of the Court, very witty and handſom; the <hi>Cavallero</hi> had the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to pleaſe her without deſigning it; he was ignorant of the Inclinations ſhe had for him, and ſo did not improve his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:151523:106"/> And although the Father of this amiable Creature was abſent, yet ſhe did not enjoy the more Liberty, becauſe her Brother, whoſe Name was <hi>Don Henriques,</hi> to whoſe care her Father had recommended her, continually watcht over her Actions and Behaviour; ſhe durſt not ſpeak to him ſhe lov'd, and this was a double Martyrdom, not to be able to make her Complaints, and to divide her Grief with him that caus'd it: But at laſt ſhe reſolv'd to write to him, and to find out ſome way that the Letter ſhould come to his hands; but as this was a buſineſs of the higheſt conſequence to her, ſo ſhe was at a ſtand about the choice of a Confident; and here ſhe ſtopt for ſome time, till at laſt ſhe bethought her ſelf of a Friend of hers, who had always teſtify'd abundance of kindneſs for her, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further conſideration, ſhe writ a very moving Letter to the <hi>Count de Caſtrillo,</hi> and was going to her Friend to intreat him to get it deliver'd to this <hi>Cavallero,</hi> when ſhe ſaw him paſs cloſe by her Chair; this ſight of him encreas'd her deſires to let him know her mind, and immediately taking this opportunity for her ſelf, threw the Letter ſhe had in her hand to him, at the ſame time feigning, that this was a Letter which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to her as he went by; <hi>Know my Lord,</hi> ſays he, aloud with an angry look, <hi>That it is not to me you ought to addreſs your ſelf upon ſuch a deſign as yours. Here, take the Letter, which I will not ſo much as open.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> had too much Wit not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend preſently the favourable intention of this fair one. You need not complain, Madam, ſays he to her, that I have not made uſe of your Advice; he quickly withdrew to read a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which muſt needs give him abundance of Pleaſure: by this means he was inform'd of <hi>Donna Clora</hi>'s Intentions, and what he muſt do to ſee her. He omitted nothing, he became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparately in Love, and thought himſelf, as he had reaſon, one of the happieſt <hi>Cavalleros</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> They impatiently expected the return of her Father, that they might propoſe the Marriage to him, which in all likelyhood muſt have been very acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all the Precautions that theſe young Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers took both certainly to fix and continue a Converſation, which was the Joy of their Life; yet the ſuſpicious and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Henriques</hi> diſcover'd their Intreague. He believed her Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and in the exceſs of his Rage, without ſignifying or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the leaſt ſhew, he one Night went into the Chamber of the unfortunate <hi>Dona Clora,</hi> and as ſhe was in a deep ſleep, he ſtrangl'd her in the moſt barbarous manner imaginable.</p>

               <p>Nevertheleſs, though it was known, that he was the Author of ſo wicked an Action, yet he was not proſecuted, for he had too much Credit and Intereſt; and beſides, this poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman had no kindred but what was his, and they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to encreaſe the Misfortunes of their Family, which were already but too great.</p>
               <p>After this wicked Fact, <hi>Henriques</hi> feign'd a great fit of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he appear'd no more in Publick, and had <hi>Maſs</hi> ſaid at his Houſe, and ſaw very few People; for he was very apprehenſive that <hi>Count Caſtrillo</hi> (who had not diſſembl'd his Grief, but had let it viſibly appear) would at laſt be reveng'd for his Miſtreſs, for indeed he moſt carefully ſought all Opportunities. At length, after having attempted all imaginable ways, he found out one which ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>He diſguis'd himſelf like an <hi>Aguador,</hi> that is, a Water-Bearer, theſe ſort of People load an Aſs with ſeveral great Pitchers, and ſo carry them about the City; they wear thick coarſe Cloth, their Legs are naked, and their Shooes are either cut or ſlaſht, or elſe they have Soals made faſt with Strings. Our Lover thus diſguis'd waited all day long leaning upon the ſide of a <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> whoſe waters he increas'd by his Tears; for this <hi>Well</hi> was juſt againſt the Houſe where he had ſo often ſeen his dear and fair <hi>Clara,</hi> and there it was alſo, where the inhumane <hi>Henriques</hi> dwelt. As the <hi>Count</hi> kept his Eyes continually upon this Houſe, he perceiv'd one of the Caſements half open, and at the ſame time his Enemy to draw near it, he had a Looking-Glaſs in his Hand, in which he was looking himſelf. Immediately the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Aquator</hi> threw ſome Cherry-ſtones at him, in a jeſting way, and ſome of them having hit his Face, <hi>Don Henriques</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted at the Inſolence of a Man, which appear'd to him to be only a poor <hi>Aguador,</hi> and tranſported with the firſt motions of his Anger, came down alone to chaſtize him: But he was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Street, when the <hi>Count</hi> diſcover'd himſelf, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword, which for his purpoſe he kept hid, cry'd out, <hi>Traytor that thou art, think of defending thy Life.</hi> The ſurprize and the fright had ſo amaz'd <hi>Don Henriques,</hi> that he was only able to ask quarter; but he could not obtain it from this enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Lover, who came to revenge the Death of his Miſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that had ſo cruelly murder'd her. This <hi>Count</hi> would have found it very hard to have eſcap'd, upon his doing ſuch an Action juſt at the door of a Man of note, and that had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Servants; but in that very moment that all <hi>Don Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques</hi> People were ſallying out upon the <hi>Count,</hi> happily for him, the Duke <hi>Duzeda</hi> came by with three of his Friends, they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:151523:107"/> immediately came out of their Coach, and reſcued him ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, that he made his Eſcape, and we do not yet hear where he is; I am concern'd for him, becauſe I know him, and that he is a very honeſt Man.</p>
               <p>It is very common in this Country, to aſſaſſinate one for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cauſes, and Cuſtom even authorizes the Fact, for every angry Difference; for example, If one give an other a Box o'th' Ear, or ſtrikes him on the Face with his Hat, his Handkerchief, or his Glove, or has wrong'd him, in calling him <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or lets drop any words that reflect on the Virtue of his Wife, theſe things I ſay muſt be no otherwiſe reveng'd than by Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they give this Reaſon, that after ſuch Affronts, it would not be juſt for a Man to venture his Life in ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon equal terms, where the <hi>Offended</hi> might periſh by the hand of the <hi>Aggreſſor.</hi> They'll keep a Revenge twenty Years together if they cannot ſooner meet with a fit Occaſion to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it: and if they happen to die before they have got Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, they leave their Children Inheritors of their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as of their Eſtates, and the beſt way for a Man that hath given any Affront to another, is for ever to forſake his Country. I was lately told of a conſiderable Man, that after he had liv'd twenty Years in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to avoid an ill turn from another to whom he had given ſome Offence, and having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that not only he but his Son was dead, believ'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure. He returns to <hi>Madrid,</hi> after he had taken care to change his Name that he might not be known; but all this was not able to ſave him, for the Grandſon of him that thought himſelf abus'd, though he was but twelve Years old, caus'd this Perſon to be murder'd quickly after his return.</p>
               <p>The Men that committed theſe horrid Actions are commonly hir'd from <hi>Valentia;</hi> It is a City in <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe People are wicked to exceſs; there's not any Crime which they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately commit for Money; they wear <hi>Stillettos,</hi> and Fire Arms which go off without any noiſe. There are two ſorts of theſe <hi>Stillettos,</hi> one about the length of a ſhort Ponyard, but not thicker than a thick needle, and made of excellent Steel, ſquare and ſharp edg'd. This Inſtrument wounds mortally for entring very deep, and making no bigger an Orifice than an needle; no Blood comes out, nay hardly can one perceive the place where it entred, and ſo being impoſſible to dreſs it, they almoſt conſtantly die. The other ſort is longer, and no thicker than the little finger, but ſo hard and ſtrong that I have ſeen one of them at one blow ſtruck throw a thick Walnut-Tree Table. Theſe ſort of Arms are forbidden to be carry'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:151523:108"/> 
                  <hi>Bayonnets</hi> are in <hi>France;</hi> neither is it lawful to carry thoſe Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Piſtols which fire without noiſe; but yet notwithſtanding the Prohibition, ſeveral Perſons make uſe of them.</p>
               <p>I have been told, that a Perſon of Quality thinking he had a juſt cauſe to deſtroy one of his Enemies, went to a <hi>Bandolero</hi> of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and gave him a Sum of Money to murder him, but afterwards he was reconciled to his Enemy; and being willing to uſe a good Conſcience, he made it his firſt buſineſs to acquaint the <hi>Bandolero</hi> with what had paſt, that ſo he might have a care not to kill this Man. The <hi>Bandolero</hi> ſeeing his Service needleſs, offer'd to return the Money, but he that gave it, entreated him to keep it; <hi>Well,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am a Man of Honour, I ſhall keep your Money, and I will kill your Man.</hi> The other earneſtly begg'd him to do nothing, ſeeing they were now friends. <hi>Look you,</hi> ſays he to him, <hi>all that I can do, is to give you your choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhall be you or him, for to gain your Money honeſtly, there's a neceſſity I muſt kill one of you.</hi> And notwithſtanding all the Entreaties of this Perſon, he perſiſted in his deſign, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. It had been an eaſie matter to have ſeiz'd him, but there was too much danger in't; for thoſe <hi>Bandoleros</hi> are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and united, that if any one of them ſhould be executed, the Death of him is certainly and quickly reveng'd. Theſe Wretches are never without a Liſt of their wicked Actions they have committed, and count it an honour to them; and when any one would ſet them on work, they ſhew that, and ask, whether they deſire them quickly diſpatch'd, or to give them a languiſhing Wound. Theſe are the moſt pernicious People in the Univerſe. Indeed if I ſhould tell you all the Tragical Stories which I hear every day, you would grant that this Country is the very Theatre of the moſt horrid Scenes in the World. Love frequently furniſhes the matter, either for its Satisfaction or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. There is nothing that a <hi>Spaniard</hi> will not undertake, nor nothing that is above either his Courage or Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Jealouſie</hi> is their prevailing Paſſion, yet they do not pretend it ſo much out of Love, as Reſentment and Pride; for they cannot bear to ſee another prefer'd before them, and every thing which contributes to affront them, makes them deſparate; let theſe things be how they will, one thing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, that it is a moſt furious and barbarous Nation in this Affair. The Women keep not company with Men; but yet they very well underſtand how to write and appoint Meetings when they have a mind; notwithſtanding the danger is great both for themſelves, the Lover and the Meſſenger; but in ſpite of all that, by their Wit and their Money, they make a ſhift to deceive the moſt cunning <hi>Argus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:151523:108"/>
               <p>It is unaccountable that Men who put every thing in practice to ſatisfie their Revengeful Minds, and who are guilty of ſuch abominable Actions, ſhould even be ſcrupulouſly <hi>Religious,</hi> at the ſame time they are going to ſtab their Enemy. And that they may not fail in their Enterprize, they muſt forſooth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their <hi>nine days task of Devotion for the Souls in Purgatory,</hi> and recommend themſelves to the <hi>Relicks</hi> they carry about them, which they often kiſs. I would not be thought to fix this Character upon the whole Nation; it may be affirm'd that there's as good People as in any part of the World, and that they are endow'd with a mighty <hi>Greatneſs of Mind.</hi> I'll give you ſome Inſtances of this laſt, which perhaps though you'll look upon as Follies, for every thing has two handles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conneſtable de Caſtille</hi> is for certain, one of the richeſt Lords of the Court in Lands; but as he has the ſame fault as others like him ſelf, which is to be careleſs in looking after his Intereſt, ſo he is ill furniſh'd with Money. The Penſions which the King allows him, as he is <hi>Doyen</hi> or Chief of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, Conneſtable of Caſtille,</hi> and <hi>Grand Falconer,</hi> are ſo conſiderable, as to ſupply all his wants, but he is ſo haughty, that he will not receive any thing upon that Account. He gives theſe Reaſons, <hi>That when a Subject has Eſtate enough to live upon, he ought not to be chargeable to his Prince, but ought to ſerve him, and eſteem himſelf happy; that to be paid for what he does is mercenary and ſlaviſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Arcas,</hi> alias <hi>d'Avero,</hi> hath likewiſe another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate humour; he pretends that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> has u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd the Crown from his Family, and therefore when he ſpeaks of him, he never calls him any thing, but Duke <hi>de Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance;</hi> in the mean while, this Man has forty thouſand Crowns a year in <hi>Portugal,</hi> of which he does not enjoy a farthing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not ſubmit to kiſs the King's hand, nor to do him homage.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath ſent him word, that he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with his coming himſelf, provided he will ſend in his ſtead one of his Sons, either the eldeſt or the youngeſt, which he will, and that he will then let him receive his Rents; and moreover, will pay him all the Arrears, which amount to an immenſe Sum. The Duke <hi>d'Avero</hi> will not ſo much as hear it mention'd: He ſays, that ſeeing he has loſt the Crown, it would be a ſhame for forty thouſand Crowns a year, to ſubmit to the Uſurper; that the greater evil takes away the ſenſe of the leſſer; that the Glory the King would receive from his Homage, would exceed the profit he gets from his Revenue;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:151523:109"/> and that he would have cauſe to reproach him, for having done an honour to him which was not his due.</p>
               <p>The laſt I reſerve for you, is the Prince <hi>Deſtillano;</hi> he hath Places and Commiſſions to diſpoſe of at the <hi>Contratraction</hi> in <hi>Sevile,</hi> to the value of fourſcore thouſand <hi>Livres</hi> a year. He had rather loſe them, than ſo much as ſet his hand to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſpatches, ſaying, It is not agreeble to the Generoſity of ſuch a <hi>Cavallero</hi> as he is, to trouble himſelf to ſign his Name for ſo ſmall a matter; for you muſt know, that theſe fourſcore thouſand <hi>Livers</hi> are not in one Article, it may be there is above thirty; and when his Secretary preſents to him a diſpatch or grant of a Place, worth four or five thouſand <hi>Livres,</hi> he will refuſe to ſign it, and alledges his Quality, always ſaying, <hi>Eſto es una Mineria,</hi> that is, it is but a Trifle. The King however is not ſo nice in the matter, for he fills up the Places for him, and receives the profit to himſelf.</p>
               <p>You'll ſay now, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Fools with this their fantaſtick Grandeur; and perhaps you are in the right, but for my part, and I think I know 'em pretty well, I am not of that Opinion; yet nevertheleſs I'll own, that whatever difference can be found in comparing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> it muſt be to our advantage; but it does not ſeem fit for me to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in determining the matter, for my Intereſt is too much concern'd to let me judge impartially; but yet I am perſwaded, that there are very few rational Perſons, who would not make the ſame Judgment.</p>
               <p>There are fewer Strangers that come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> than to any City in the World, and they have reaſon; for unleſs they have ſomebody to procure them Lodging in ſome private Houſe, they'll run the hazard of being very ill lodg'd, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not very ready to offer their Houſes to any body, becauſe of their Wives, of whom they are extream jealous. I do not know, that in all this City, there's any more than two <hi>Inns,</hi> whereof at one of them, they eat after the <hi>French</hi> mode; and when theſe are full (which they are very quickly, being very little) one knows not what to do; add to this, That there's no conveniency for paſſing too and fro in the Town, Hackney, or hyr'd Coaches are ſcarce enough, but one may have as many Chairs as one will; yet it is ſeldom that Men are carry'd in them, unleſs they be very old or infirm. But after all, why ſhould Strangers come to <hi>Madrid?</hi> That which is fineſt and the moſt amiable, is always hid, I mean the Women, there's no converſing with them; thoſe Women that may be ſeen, are ſuch dangerous Creatures for a Man's Health, that it muſt be a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:151523:109"/> great Curioſity indeed, that a Man can reſolve to ſatisfie at ſo much riſque; yet in ſpight of all this, the only Pleaſure, and the ſole Enjoyment of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is to contract ſome League; even Youths of Quality that are rich, begin at the Age of twelve or thirteen years to entertain a Concubine-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, which they call <hi>Amancebade,</hi> for whom they neglect their Studies, and make away with whatever they can catch up in their Father's Houſe, but 'tis not long before thoſe Creatures give them cauſe to repent of their Folly.</p>
               <p>But that which is terrible is, That there are few Perſons in this Country, either of one or t'other Sex, and even of thoſe whoſe Quality diſtinguiſhes them, that are free from that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Diſeaſe; their Children either bring it into the World with them from their Mother's Womb, or ſuck it from the Nurſe; a Virgin may juſtly be ſuſpected to have it, and they are hardly perſwaded to be cur'd of it, they are ſo certain of falling again into the ſame Condition. But doubtleſs this Diſeaſe is not ſo dangerous in <hi>Spain</hi> as in other Countries, for they ſtill preſerve their Hair very fine, and their Teeth very good: At <hi>Court,</hi> and amongſt the Women of the higheſt Quality, they diſcourſe of it as they do of a Fever, or the Meagrim, and they all bear the Diſtemper patiently, without ſo much as troubling themſelves one minute about it. As they know not but that the moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Women, and the youngeſt Child may have it, ſo they never let blood in the Arm, but always in the Foot; they'll let a Child three Weeks old blood in the Foot, and this is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a Cuſtom amongſt them, that unleſs it be ſome very able Surgeon, they know not how to let blood in the Arm. I was indiſpos'd, and was forc'd to make uſe of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's <hi>valet de Chambre,</hi> to let me blood in the Arm. By all that I have told you, it is eaſie to judge, that this is the <hi>Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> preſent which a <hi>Spaniard</hi> makes to his Wife, and that though they marry, they do not quit their Miſtreſſes, be they never ſo dangerous. Every time theſe Miſtreſſes are let blood, their Gallants are oblig'd to give them a compleat new ſuit of Apparel; and yet you muſt obſerve they wear ten or twelve Petticoats at a time; ſo that this cauſes no ordinary Expence. The Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> underſtanding that his Miſtreſs was juſt let blood, and ſo could not tarry till the Tailor made her a ſuit which he intended for her, he ſent her one that was juſt brought home for the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> his Lady, who is extream beautiful. It is a common ſaying with him, <hi>That to be the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Man, he would only wiſh a Miſtreſs as handſom as his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:151523:110"/>
               <p>The great Lords which return very rich from their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (whether for the moſt part they go poor enough, and where they pillage and extort all they can, becauſe they are but for five years time) do not lay out their Money when they come home, in the purchaſe of Lands; they keep it in their Cheſts, and as long as it laſts, they live at a great rate, for they think it is below 'em to improve their Money. Following this Method, it would be very hard for the greateſt Treaſure not to be quickly exhauſted; but the future diſturbs them but little, for every one of them hopes either for ſome <hi>Vice-Royalty,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Poſt,</hi> which will effectually repair all their ill Husbandry, and reſtore them to a good Condition: And it muſt be own'd that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is capable both to ſatisfie the Ambition of his Subjects, and to reward their Services; and indeed, many of his Subjects fill up the Places of divers <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes,</hi> which were the moſt eminent Men of their Age.</p>
               <p>The difference is very remarkable between thoſe <hi>Sovereigns</hi> heretofore, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at preſent; it is leſs as to their Birth, than as to their Merit; for the Families of the great Lords are very Illuſtrious, there's many of them that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Kings of <hi>Caſtille, Navarre, Arragon</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> but yet this does not hinder ſeveral of them (for I make an exception) from contradicting the vertue of their Anceſtors; but then let's ſee, how theſe are educated: They do not ſtudy, neither have they any able Maſters; as ſoon as they are deſign'd for the Sword, no further care is taken to teach them either Latin or Hiſtory; but one would think they ſhould at leaſt be taught what belongs to their Art, ſuch as the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> to <hi>fence,</hi> and <hi>ride</hi> the Horſe; but they do not ſo much as think of theſe Matters. Here are no <hi>Academies,</hi> nor Maſters to teach ſuch things; the young Men paſs that time which they ſhould employ for their Inſtruction, in a wretched Lazineſs, either in walking about, or courting ſome Lady; and yet in ſpight of all this, they are perſuaded, that there are not any People in the World which deſerve publick Admiration more than they do. They believe <hi>Madrid</hi> to be the very Center of all Glory and Happineſs, of all Arts and Sciences, and of all Delights and Pleaſures; in dying, they only wiſh their Children the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and afterwards that of <hi>Madrid;</hi> by this means you ſee they exalt this City above <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> with ſo much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction do they live in't. And 'tis this which hinders them from viſiting other Courts, and there acquiring that <hi>Politeneſs</hi> which they have not amongſt themſelves, and to which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:151523:110"/> Strangers. And 'tis this alſo which makes them ſo eager to return home to <hi>Madrid,</hi> let them be where they will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſent by the King, or let them be there in what Rank or Station they will; let them be never ſo much honour'd, and heap up never ſo much Wealth, yet the love to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Prepoſſeſſion for that, hath ſuch a power over them, as to make them renounce every thing; and they had rather chooſe to lead a mean poor Life, (ſo it be not obſerv'd) without any Train, Grandeur or Diſtinction, provided it be but at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very ſeldom, that a Father lets his Son travel abroad, but keeps him at home, and ſuffers him to take up what Cuſtoms he pleaſes; you may eaſily believe, that generally theſe are none of the beſt; for there's a certain Age, when Youth aims at nothing elſe, but to gratifie their Appetite, and enjoy Pleaſures. One entices and draws another, and that which ought to be ſeverely reprov'd, is authoriz'd by the Example of thoſe, on whom they depend. Add to this, That they make them marry, as one may ſay, as ſoon as they are out of the Cradle. At the Age of ſixteen or ſeventeen years they turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World a young Man with a Wife that is but a Child, and this at once makes him leſs capable to know his Duty, and puts him upon being more debauch'd, becauſe he is his own Maſter under no controul: by this means, he paſſes his Life in a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-corner, like a Man in his decriped old Age; and becauſe this gentle Sluggard is of an Illuſtrious Family, he muſt be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to govern a People that muſt ſuffer through his Ignorance; but that which is yet worſe, is, That ſuch a Man taking himſelf for ſome great and knowing Perſon, acts only by his own head, without conſulting or adviſing with any body, and ſo does every thing awkwardly and abſurdly. The Wife, it may be, is not better ſtor'd with Wit and Parts; her mighty greatneſs, with which ſhe prides her ſelf, is the only thing that can make her be regarded; and thus Perſons of the higheſt Capacity, muſt be ſubject to two Animals, which are made their Superiors.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, let us be juſt, and render to <hi>Ceſar</hi> his due. It muſt be own'd, that when Heaven hath been ſo kind to a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as to give him a good Education, and let him travel and ſee the World, he makes a better improvement than any body. Nature has been kinder to them than they are to themſelves; they are born with more Wit than others; they have a great quickneſs of Mind joyn'd with great Solidity; they ſpeak and deliver their words with eaſe, they have a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; their Style is near and conciſe, and they are quick of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:151523:111"/> Apprehenſion. It is eaſie to teach them whatever they have a mind to; they are perfect Maſters in Politicks, and when there's a Neceſſity for't, they are temperate and laborious. Without queſtion, ſeveral great Qualities may be found amongſt them, ſuch as Generoſity, Secreſie, Friendſhip, Bravery, and in a word, all thoſe Endowments of Mind, which go to make up a perfect, good, and vertuous Man. And here methinks, I have a fair opportunity to conclude this Letter, and to beget in you an eſteem of theſe People. I ſhould not be ſorry, if I could procure them this Happineſs; for their Manners do not ſuit ſo ill with me, as with a great many others, who cry out againſt them, and condemn them, before they have either examin'd or known them. For my part, I muſt needs ſay, that there is here, both good and bad, as there is in all other parts of the World.</p>

               <p>HEre's a general rejoycing, ſince the arrival of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de los Balbaces,</hi> who brought certain News that the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> had granted <hi>Mademoiſel</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He ſo impatiently expected theſe Tydings, that there was hardly an hour paſs'd, that he did not ask if the <hi>Courrier</hi> was not come; and as ſoon as he knew it, he immediately went to hear <hi>Te Deum</hi> at our Lady <hi>d' Atocha's</hi> Church. As the Ladies do not go thither, ſo they are to content to dreſs themſelves very fine, and place themſelves in their Windows. I choſe this, and I thought I ſhould have been both choak'd and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was ſo exceſſive duſty. I ſaw the King in his Coach of green Oyl-cloth; he had but a ſmall attendance, for ſome twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Halbardiers cloth'd in yellow with truſt Breeches like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, made up his Guard, marching before and behind him. The Courtiers Coaches indeed that accompany'd him, were ſo numerous that they could hardly be told; the People every where crowding, even to the tops of the Houſes, cry'd out <hi>Viva el Roy, Deos le Bendiga,</hi> and ſeveral added, <hi>Viva el Reina nueſtra Seinnora.</hi> There was not the leaſt Houſe or Street with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:151523:111"/> its ſpread Tables; every body had their Garlick, Leeks and Onions in their hands, inſomuch that they perfum'd the Air with them, and they were even debauch'd with drinking their Majeſty's Health in Water: For dear Couſin, though I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned it to you, yet methinks I may repeat it here, That there never was People ſo temperate as theſe, eſpecially in Wine; and they have ſo ſtrange an abhorrence for thoſe that are guilty of Intemperance, that by their Law, a Man that can be prov'd but once to have been drunk, is refus'd for being a Witneſs in any Court of Juſtice where he is offer'd, and after a ſharp reproof is ſent away. And if it happen, that one calls another <hi>Boracho,</hi> that is <hi>Drunkard,</hi> this Injury is ſure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd with Murther.</p>
               <p>That Night the King was at <hi>Antocha;</hi> we illuminated all our Houſes with great Flamboys of white Wax which they call <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas;</hi> they are longer than thoſe that are us'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> to light the Coaches at night, but withal, they are a great deal dearer, not only becauſe the Wax is brought at great Charges from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the World, but alſo becauſe there is a prodigious quantity of it conſum'd in <hi>Spain.</hi> And when they make Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, they are not contented to ſet up four or ſix Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys, but they muſt put two in every Balcony, and two at each Window up to the higheſt Story; there are ſome Houſes which thus require four or five hundred. Every where there were Bonefires made, and we went to the Palace to ſee a <hi>Maſquerade</hi> of a hundred and fifty Lords which they ſaid was to be there. I cannot imagine why they call this Diverſion by that Name, for they were not at all <hi>maskt;</hi> commonly they chooſe the darkeſt Night. All the Courtiers are mounted upon their fineſt Horſes, every Horſe was covered with Silver Gauze and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings embroider'd with Gold and Pearl. The <hi>Cavalleros</hi> were cloath'd in Black, with colour'd Taby Sleeves, embroider'd with Silk and Bugles; they wore little Hatts button'd up with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and in them a Plume of Feathers, they had rich Scarfes and many Jewels; but with all this, their Black Cloaks and their ugly Collars ſtrangely disfigure them. They ride a Horſeback like the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> that is, as they call it a <hi>Genita,</hi> their Stirrups are ſo ſhort that their knees are even with, and reſt upon the Tops of the Horſes ſhoulders. I cannot yet reconcile my Eyes to this Faſhion; they ſay, that thus they can better raiſe and put themſelves forth againſt any that aſſaults them. But to return to the <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> they all met together at an appointed Place, which uſually is at one of the Gates of the City. The Streets through which they were to go, were all ſtrewed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:151523:112"/> with Sand, and on each ſide there was a kind of Chaffing diſhes ſet upon Poles, which beſide the white Wax Flamboys gave a great Light, there were alſo placed ſeveral very clear Lanthorns in Windows, which made a very fine Show. Every <hi>Cavallero</hi> had a great many Footmen, which were cloath'd in Cloath of Gold and Silver; they went by their Maſters ſides with Flamboys. The Maſters marcht four in a rank very ſoftly, each holding a Flamboy alſo; they went all over the City attended with Trumpets, Timbrels, Bagpipes and Flutes, and when they came to the Palace which was illuminated, and the Court co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Sand, they took ſeveral Turns, and run and puſht againſt one another with a Deſign to throw each other down with theſe tricks. Prince <hi>Alexander de Parma,</hi> who is of a prodigious bigneſs fell down, and the fall of him made as great a noiſe as the ſhooting of a moderate high-hill, they had much ado to carry him off, for he was grievouſly bruis'd with his Fall; there were ſeveral of them with their great Spectacles on, but particularly the Marqueſs <hi>D' Aſtorgas,</hi> who does not only wear them for gravity ſake, but for need, for he is old; but yet for all that, he is frolickſom, he will be <hi>Meyor Domo</hi> to the young Queen, and he is a <hi>Grandee</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I ſpeak of a <hi>Grandee</hi> of <hi>Spain, Don Fernand de Tolledo,</hi> told me t'other day a thing pleaſant enough. His Father in Law, who is the Marqueſs <hi>De Palacios,</hi> lives at a horrid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe rate, for it ſeems he is one of thoſe profeſt Gallants of the Ladies of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> and to arrive to that, one muſt both have a great deal of Wit, and ſhew abundance of Magnificence, I mean a certain peculiar ſort of Wit that's neat and refin'd, he muſt have choice Phraſes and Expreſſions, and ſome ways and modes not common, he muſt underſtand how to write both in Proſe and Verſe, and that too better than another. In a word, one muſt both talk and do in this <hi>Pallace</hi>-Gallantry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quite another rate than is us'd in the City. But to return to the Marqueſs <hi>De Palacios.</hi> There was a publick Feſtival appointed by the <hi>King,</hi> this Marqueſs wanted Money to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there, he is Lord of ſeveral Towns, it came into his head to go down poſt to them; aſſoon as he arriv'd, at the firſt, he caus'd Papers to be ſet up, That all thoſe of that Town which deſir'd to be made <hi>Grandees,</hi> ſhould immediately come to him. There was not either Juſtice, Burgeſs or Tradeſman, which was not preſently fill'd with vehement Ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for the <hi>Grandeza</hi> his Houſe was crowded with all ſorts of People, he agreed with them every one ſeverally in private, and got as much as he could of them, and afterwards he made
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:151523:112"/> them all be covered before him, and gave them Patents in Form juſt as the <hi>King</hi> does, when he makes any one a <hi>Grandee.</hi> His Invention ſucceeded two well in the firſt Town, not to practiſe it in the reſt: He found amongſt them the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to give him Money, that through his means they might be <hi>Grandees,</hi> with this trick, he got a conſiderable Sum, and away he comes, and makes a ſplendid Shew at Court. But as a Man is never without Enemies, ſo there were ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that had a mind to make uſe of this pleaſant Frolick to put him out of the <hi>King</hi>'s Favour. His Majeſty was told of it, and the Marquis juſtified himſelf well enough, in ſaying all thoſe to whom he had granted permiſſion to be covered before him, being born his Vaſſals, they ow'd more reſpect than to dare to take this liberty without his leave, and that therefore he had made them <hi>Grandees,</hi> as to himſelf. And after this the thing was only lookt upon as a merry jeſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Marqueſs</hi> comes often to ſee us, and as he belong'd to the late Court, ſo Yeſterday he told me, that a famous <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> being one day with the late <hi>King</hi> in the Terraſs-walk of the Pallace, the <hi>King</hi> askt him the height of that Place, he gaz'd up into the Air, and nam'd a certain Height. The <hi>King</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately order'd them to raiſe the Pavement of the <hi>Terraſs</hi> about three or four fingers, and in the Night it was done. The next Morning he caus'd the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> to come to him, and being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terraſs with him, ſays he to him, I ſpoke laſt night of the height you told me of this Walk, but there was ſome that maintain'd that you were miſtaken, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he, I dare ſay, I was not miſtaken; But conſider it well ſays the <hi>King,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we'll him aſham'd, which boaſts himſelf to be a more knowing Man than you. Immediately he began again to make his Obſervations, the <hi>King</hi> ſaw him change colour, and ſeem to be at a great loſs; but at laſt he drew nigh the <hi>King,</hi> and ſaid, what I told your Majeſty Yeſterday was true, but to day I find, that either the Terraſs is rais'd, or the Heavens are ſunk down a little lower. The <hi>King</hi> ſmil'd, and told him the trick he had put upon him.</p>
               <p>That I may give you an Account of other matters, I muſt tell you, that the <hi>King</hi> has in his Family three Perſons which by way of Eminency are call'd, the great Officers, the <hi>Mayor Domo Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Sumiller of the Body,</hi> and the <hi>Maſter of the Horſe.</hi> Theſe three Places are thus diſtinguiſht, the <hi>Mayor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> commands in the <hi>Pallace,</hi> the Buſineſs of the <hi>Sumiller</hi> of the Body, is in the <hi>King</hi>'s Chamber, and the Maſter of the Horſe, orders all things in every Place, except the <hi>Pallace.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:151523:113"/>
               <p>After theſe come the Gentlemen of the <hi>Kings</hi> Bed-chamber, they wear at their Girdle for a mark of their Dignity, a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Key. There are three ſorts of theſe Keys; the firſt, gives the Employment of the Gentleman of the Bed-chamber; the ſecond, the Entrance with the Employment; and the third is call'd, <hi>Clavae Capona,</hi> which only gives Entrance into the Anti-chamber. The Number of theſe Gentlemen is great, there are Forty of thoſe for Service, which take it in turns every day, and for the moſt part they are <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Mayor Domo,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Steward</hi> in Ordinary, have the ſame Acceſs as the Gentlmen of the Bed-chamber. The Perſons of higheſt Quality fill up theſe Places, for the moſt part they are the ſecond Sons of the <hi>Grandees,</hi> they wait in turns every Week, and when the High-Steward is abſent, they are inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Power, theſe alſo introduce <hi>Foreign</hi> Miniſters when they have Audience, there are eight of them, ſometimes more, but ſeldom fewer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> hath three Companies for his Guards, but they have not any thing that agrees with one another. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>De Falces</hi> commands the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> or <hi>Burgundian</hi> Guard, it conſiſts of a hundred <hi>Halbardiers,</hi> and although here, they call them the Yeomen of the Guard; yet they may be call'd the Life Guard; the <hi>German</hi> Guard conſiſts of the ſame Number, <hi>Don Pedro D' Arragon</hi> is Captain of it, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guard is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of a hundred Halberdiers, and are commanded by the Count <hi>De los Arcos.</hi> He is likewiſe Captain of another Company of a hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> call'd the Guards of the <hi>Lancilla,</hi> and this never appears, but at great Ceremonies, and at the Funerals of Kings. The Affairs of the State are manag'd by a Chief Miniſter which they call <hi>Privado,</hi> he hath under him a Secretary of State, whoſe Office is in the Pallace. All Buſineſs that come to the <hi>King</hi> and the Miniſter, ought to paſs directly through his hands, and as he diſpatches alſo whatever the <hi>King</hi> orders, ſo he is call'd <hi>Secretario del deſpacho <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> of State, and divers other <hi>Councils</hi> examine all matters, and the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Chief Miniſter,</hi> afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them, there are a great many Counſellors: Here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Names of thoſe which at preſent compoſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>State, Viz.</hi> The <hi>Conſtable De Caſtile</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Valeſaco's,</hi> is the Preſident, the Duke <hi>D' Albe,</hi> the Duke <hi>De Medicina Celi, Don Pedro D' Arragon,</hi> the Admiral of <hi>Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>D' Aſtorgas,</hi> the Prince <hi>De Stillano,</hi> the Duke <hi>D' Oſſona,</hi> the Count <hi>De Chinchon, Don Vincent Gouzaga,</hi> Prince <hi>De Guaſtalla, Don Lewis Portocarrero</hi> Cardinal Archbiſhop of

               </p>
               <p>Beſides This Council, which is the principal, there is that of the <hi>Inquiſition of War,</hi> of the Orders of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Hazienda,</hi> of the <hi>Croiſado,</hi> and of <hi>Flanders,</hi> there is alſo the Chamber of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> of the <hi>Alcaides de Corta,</hi> of the <hi>Contaduria, D' Apoſento, Delos Boſques Reales, De Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liones,</hi> and <hi>De Competancias.</hi> But do not think, dear Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that the Salleries and Profits of thoſe Places are ſmall. For inſtance, The Counſellors of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> make from eighteen to twenty thouſand Crowns a Year of their Places. And here 'tis pertinent to tell you, that 'tis thought no Places are ſold in this Countrey, at leaſt it is not known; in in all appearace they are beſtow'd upon Merit or Birth, but yet underhand, there are ſuch conſiderable Preſents made, that to get a <hi>Vice Royalty,</hi> they'll give Five thouſand Piſtols, and ſometimes more. That which would be call'd <hi>Buying</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countrey, at <hi>Madrid</hi> is term'd giving a <hi>Regalio,</hi> that is, making a Preſent, and one is equivalent to the other, with this difference, that a Place, or a Government which one <hi>buys,</hi> is yours as long as you live, and ſometimes paſſes by Inheritance to your Children, either by natural Right, or the Conceſſion of the Prince; but in <hi>Spain,</hi> they enjoy a Place which coſt them very dear, only three or five Years at moſt. It is eaſie to believe that thoſe who advance ſo much, are very certain to reimburſe themſelves both Principal and Intereſt. From this Practice the People are horribly oppreſt, they have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually upon them, either a new <hi>Vice Roy,</hi> or Governour, which comes from draining himſelf of all the ready-Money which he could either make of his own and ſometimes of his Friends, to bribe the <hi>Court.</hi> Thus he comes hungry, and he has but a ſhort time to enrich himſelf, and ſo the poor People are on all hands pillaged, without ſo much as being able to have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints heard. But it is yet quite another thing in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where Gold is ſo plentiful, and they are ſo far from the <hi>King</hi> and his Miniſters. It is certain they bring from thence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Sums, as I think, I have already intimated to you, even the <hi>Religious</hi> as they call them, who are ſent to preach there, return not without forty and fifty thouſand Crowns, which they have heap'd up in four or five Years time; ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their <hi>Vow of Poverty,</hi> they find out the ſecret of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich; and during their Life they are ſuffer'd to enjoy the Fruit of their <hi>Miſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:151523:114"/>
               <p>The <hi>Monaſteries</hi> here, have yet another piece of Craft, which commonly ſucceeds, when a <hi>Religieus</hi> Perſon or <hi>Fryer</hi> happens to be the only Son. If his Father is rich, they beg him to leave his Eſtate to the <hi>Convent,</hi> where his Son has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Habit, upon condition that he ſhall manage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it whilſt he lives, but after his Death that the <hi>Monaſtery</hi> ſhall inherit it, and put up Prayers and ſay <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. By this means there are profes'd <hi>Fryars</hi> which have ten thouſand Crowns a Year, at their diſpoſal. This Affluence in a Countrey where Reaſon has put little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Affections, does not always make them more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if there are any that uſe it well, there are abundance which abuſe it.</p>
               <p>It is known, that every year there comes from the <hi>Indies,</hi> above five and thirty Millions of Crowns, but yet not a quarter part of this ever goes into the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Coffers. Theſe Treaſures ſpread themſelves over all <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>French, Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> draw away the beſt ſhares of it. Methinks, this does not ſuit with the refin'd Policy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to waſte their own Subjects in digging Gold out of the Mines, to let other Nations, with whom they are often at War, reap the Profit; but the natural Lazineſs which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from working, and to have at home Manufactures of their of their own, obliges them to have recourſe to thoſe, who can furniſh their Countrey with the Merchandizes they want.</p>
               <p>As Strangers dare not venture to go there, becauſe it is upon no leſs penalty than hanging, ſo they contrive to ſend their effects in the Names of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchants, with whom they meet with all the Fidelity imaginable; and if the <hi>King</hi> would, he could not hinder Strangers from receiving what is properly theirs; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this occaſion, had rather looſe their Lives, than any wrong ſhould come to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There's one thing remarkable, and that is, when the <hi>Flota</hi> comes to an Anchor at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> there are Men who make publick profeſſion to aſſiſt in cheating the <hi>King</hi> of his Cuſtoms upon Silver and other Merchandizes. It is as much their Trade and Livelyhood, as for a Banker to deal in Money. They call them <hi>Metadors;</hi> and as much Knaves as they are towards the <hi>King,</hi> yet one muſt do them the right to ſay, they are not ſo to the private men which agree with them for a certain reward ſecurely to lodge their Silver in ſuch a place of the City as they ſhall deſire. And this practice is ſo certain and ſafe, that one never hears of any that have violated their Truſt: It
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:151523:114"/> were eaſie to puniſh theſe men for the Frauds they are guilty of againſt the <hi>King,</hi> but there would be Inconveniencies to the prejudice of Trade, perhaps far greater, than the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would bring Advantage; ſo that the Government and Magiſtrates take no notice of what paſſes. There might alſo be an eaſie remedy found out to hinder the <hi>King</hi> from loſing all upon this occaſion; and that is, to abate the Duties a little, which indeed are very high, and ſo what is given to theſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadors,</hi> and ſomewhat more, might be paid to the <hi>Cotratacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for naturally the Merchants do not love cheating, and are continually afraid of paying at once, what they have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for half a ſcore Voyages; but 'tis the humour of the <hi>Spaniards, To have all or nothing,</hi> and very often they have <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> As to <hi>Madrid,</hi> it is impoſſible to find there any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Robbers and Cheats than the Magiſtrates and Officers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; theſe are the Men, that with Impunity appropriate to themſelves the <hi>Kings</hi> Cuſtoms, and who cheat him after ſuch a rate, that 'tis no wonder if he ſo often wants Money: but they are not ſatisfied with cheating their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> they muſt alſo abuſe and pillage the <hi>People;</hi> and although the Laws of this Nation are not only very juſt, but equitable, yet no body ſeems to be ſenſible of them: Thoſe very Perſons into whoſe Hands they are put, and who are ſet on purpoſe to execute them, are the firſt that break and corrupt them.</p>
               <p>If you'll but give Money to an <hi>Alcalde,</hi> or to an <hi>Alguazil,</hi> you may have the moſt innocent Perſon in the World arreſted or ſeized, and then thrown into ſome naſty dark hole of a Priſon, and there periſh with hunger, without any proceeding or coming to a Tryal, and wthout any Order or Degree; and when the poor wretch is let out of Priſon, he muſt not ſo much as think of doing himſelf right againſt this wicked Officer of Juſtice. This ſort of People are generally much favour'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, but here they are beyond all meaſure; and righteous <hi>Judges</hi> in this Country are more ſcarce than in any Country whatever.</p>
               <p>Thieves, Murderers, Poyſoners, and the greateſt Criminals imaginable, remain ſafe and quiet at <hi>Madrid,</hi> provided they are not rich, for if they be, they are ſure to be diſturb'd for the ſake of that.</p>
               <p>They do not judge <hi>Criminal</hi> Matters above twice or thrice a year; it is with the greateſt difficulty that they bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cauſe any Criminal to dye, who is, ſay they, a man like them, their Country-man, and the <hi>King</hi>'s Subject; they ſend moſt either to the Mines, or to the Gallies, and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:151523:115"/> Wretch is condemned to be hang'd, he is carry'd upon an Aſs, with his Face to the Tail; he is cloath'd in black, and a Scaffold is erected for him, that he may make a Speech to the People, who are all upon their Knees, and in Tears, beating themſelves upon their Breaſts: After he has ſpent what time he will in his Harangue, he is diſpatch'd with a great deal of Gravity; and as theſe Examples of Juſtice are very rare, ſo they make a mighty impreſſion upon the Spectators.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the vaſt Riches, and the exceſſive haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Preſumption of the great <hi>Lords,</hi> yet they obey the leaſt Order of the <hi>King,</hi> with that exactneſs and Reſpect which cannot be ſufficiently prais'd. Upon the firſt Command, they depart, they return, go to Priſon, or into Baniſhment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring. It is not poſſible to find a more perfect Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Obedience, nor a more ſincere Love, than that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their <hi>King.</hi> This Name is Sacred with them, and to bring them to whatever one has a mind, it is ſufficient to ſay, <hi>The King Wills it;</hi> 'tis under his Name, that the poor People of both the <hi>Caſtilles</hi> are ſo horribly oppreſt with Taxes: the other <hi>Kingdoms</hi> or <hi>Provinces</hi> are not ſo loaded, but boaſt themſelves for the moſt part, that they are a free People, and pay but what they have a mind to.</p>
               <p>I have already hinted to you, dear Couſin, that in every thing they exactly follow the <hi>Politicks</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> V. without conſidering that the difference of times makes a mighty altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Events of things, although they may ſeem to be alike, and in the ſame Circumſtances; and that what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the imputation of raſhneſs might have been undertaken 120 years ago under a flouriſhing Reign, would be impudent to practiſe now under a Reign that is far leſs ſo: but a vanity that is natural to them, hinders them from ſeeing, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> ſometimes permits <hi>Empires,</hi> as well as particular <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> to have their Revolutions and Periods. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> believe themſelves to be juſt the ſame People, and in the ſame Circumſtances they ever were; but though I never knew their Anceſtors, yet I dare ſay they deceive themſelves.</p>
               <p>But not to make any farther Reflexions, which perhaps are too ſerious and high for me, I will tell you, that here's a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rejoycing at <hi>Madrid</hi> for the arrival of the <hi>Flota</hi> from the <hi>Indies.</hi> As 'tis not their humour here to treaſure up Wealth, ſo this prodigious quantity of Silver, which comes all at a lump, is ſpread over all the World. One would think that theſe immenſe Summs coſt nothing, and that it is Money which chance ſent them. Hereupon the great <hi>Lords</hi> ſummon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:151523:115"/> their Creditors, and pay them with a profuſeneſs, which yet without lying, has ſomething in't that is both noble and very generous; for there are but few Countries where Liberality is ſo natural, as 'tis in this; and I muſt alſo add, that they are patient even to admiration. They have been known to endure moſt long and toilſome <hi>Sieges,</hi> in which beſides the Fatigues of War, they had nothing to ſupport them but Bread made of rotten Corn, and ſtinking Water for their Drink; and yet there are no Men in the World more nice about good Water. I ſay, notwithſtanding all this, and that they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Severities of the Weather, were half naked, and had hard Lodging, yet in ſpight of all theſe things, they have been found more brave and couragious, than when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd Plenty and Proſperity. It is true, that that Temperance which is ſo natural to them, is a mighty help to them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hunger when they are forc'd to it; they eat very little, and ſcarcely will they drink any Wine. The Cuſtom they have of eating all alone, contributes ſomething to make them ſo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; for indeed, neither their Wives, nor their Children, ever eat with them. The Maſter has his Table to himſelf, and the Miſtreſs with her Children ſit on the Floor upon a Carpet, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Mooriſh</hi> way. They ſeldom or never invite their Friends to feaſt together, ſo that they are not guilty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exceſs. Upon this account, it is their ſaying, <hi>That they only eat to live,</hi> whereas there are People, <hi>which only live to eat.</hi> Nevertheleſs, there are ſome rational People, which find this affectation too great; and as they admit of little familiarity in Converſation, ſo they perpetually live at a diſtance, and as 'twere in Ceremony with one another, without enjoying that freedom which makes that true Union, and produces that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable openneſs of Heart.</p>
               <p>This great Retirement gives them up to a thouſand Illuſions, which they call <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> it makes them ſingular, dull, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick, melancholy and jealous; whereas if they govern'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves otherwiſe, there's nothing they would not be capable of, ſince they have a wonderful vigour of Mind, an excellent Memory, good Senſe, a ſolid Judgment, and great Patience; than which, there needs no more to make a Man wiſe, to grow in Perfection, to be agreeable in Converſation, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf from the moſt polite Nation. But they are ſo far from being what naturally they might be, though at never ſo little pains, that they affect a certain Indolency which they call greatneſs of Mind; they neglect their moſt important buſineſs, and the advancement of their Fortunes. Proviſion for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:151523:116"/> gives them not the leaſt diſturbance; the only matter they are not indifferent in, is Jealouſie; they improve that to the utmoſt, the bare ſuſpicion is enough to make them ſtab their Wife or their Miſtreſs. Their Paſſion of Love is always furious, and yet the Women pleaſe themſelves in it; they ſay, they would not for all the miſchief that may befall them, have them leſs ſenſible of their unfaithfulneſs; that their deſperate Temper is a certain proof of a true Paſſion, and that they themſelves are not more moderate when they are in Love. They leave nothing unattempted to be reveng'd of thoſe they love, if they forſake them without cauſe; ſo that theſe ſort of amorous Engagements have commonly a fatal end. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not long ſince, a Woman of Quality, who had cauſe to complain of her Gallant, contriv'd to get him into a Houſe where ſhe commanded, and after ſhe had ſufficiently reproach'd him, againſt which he did but weakly defend himſelf, for he was guilty; ſhe preſented to him a Ponyard, and a Cup of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd Chocolate, leaving him only the liberty which ſort of Death he would chooſe: He did not waſte one minute to move her pitty, he very well ſaw, that in this Place ſhe was the ſtrongeſt, ſo that he tamely drank off the Chocolate without leaving a drop. After he had drunk it, ſays he to her, it had been better if you had put a little more Sugar in't, for the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made it very bitter; remember to do ſo the next time you prepare another. He was immediately ſeiz'd with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; it was very violent Poyſon, and kill'd him in an hours time; and for all this Lady ſtill lov'd him paſſionately, yet ſhe had the barbarity not to ſtir from him till he was dead.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, who is a very well accompliſh'd Man, being lately at home, they brought him word, that a Lady cover'd with a Mantle deſir'd to ſpeak with him, and that ſhe hid her ſelf ſo cloſe, they could not poſſibly ſee what ſhe was; ſhe had with her two Gentlemen Uſhers, and a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attendance. He invited her to his Chamber of <hi>Audience,</hi> and ſhe deſir'd he would cauſe every body to go out. When ſhe was alone with him, ſhe unveil'd her ſelf, and appear'd to him extream handſom. <hi>I am of an Illuſtrious Family,</hi> ſays ſhe to him, <hi>my Name is</hi> Donna Blanca de Guſman; <hi>I have deſpis'd all the Laws of Decency, in Favour of that Paſſion I have for you; I came to declare it to you, my Lord, and to tell you, that I muſt needs remain here this Night.</hi> From ſuch an impudent Speech, the Ambaſſador could not in the leaſt doubt, that this was ſome Tilt that had borrow'd a great Name, to draw him into ſome Snare: but yet with abundance of kindneſs, he told her, that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151523:116"/> till now he had never thought himſelf unhappy in the Service of the <hi>Republick,</hi> that he could wiſh he were not an <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> that ſo he might embrace the Favour ſhe offer'd him; but that being in ſuch a Station, there was little likelihood that he could give Entertainment to a Perſon of her Eminent Quality, that this might bring him into great trouble, and therefore beg'd her that ſhe would withdraw. Immediately ſhe was like a Fury, and after ſhe had revil'd and reproach'd him, ſhe drew out a <hi>Stilletto,</hi> and run upon him to have ſtab'd him. He eaſily prevented her, and having call'd one of his Gentlemen, bid him give five or ſix Piſtols to this Woman. She ſo little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd this Generoſity, and it ſo appeas'd her, that ſhe really told him, ſhe was one of thoſe Creatures he took her for, and that the reaſon why ſhe had been ſo deſperate, was, that the Gentlemen Uſhers, who waited for her below, were her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and would have broke her bones if ſhe had made no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Plot they had laid; and that beſides, ſhe was to pay for the Equipage ſhe came in, which was hir'd purpoſely for this deſign, and that ſhe had much rather have dy'd, than to have endur'd all thoſe Abuſes. The Ambaſſador was ſo taken with her pleaſant Confeſſion, that he caus'd ten Piſtols more to be given her; for, ſays he to her, ſince ſo many honeſt Folks muſt ſhare with you, your part will be too ſmall. She ſucceeded ſo well here, that ſhe went directly to the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors; but ſhe was not ſo courteouſly receiv'd there: For upon the firſt Apprehenſion of her Deſign, ſhe and her Attendance eſcapt very narrowly of being entertain'd with the Strapado. He gave her not a Sons, happy was ſhe that got out as ſhe came in, for he had an averſion for all theſe Creatures.</p>
               <p>This Morning we tarried a while in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> for an Anſwer of a Meſſage my Kinſwoman had ſent to a Gentleman that dwelt there. In this Place Fiſh is ſold, and there was a Woman which had ſome little bits of Salmon to ſell, which ſhe ſaid was freſh; ſhe made a horrid noiſe in crying it, and in calling Cuſtomers to buy it, at laſt comes a Shooemaker, which I knew for ſuch, becauſe ſhe call'd him <hi>Sinior Capatcro;</hi> he ask her for a Pound of her Salmon (and by the way, you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that every thing here is bought by the pound, even Wood and Charcoal) ſays ſhe to him, You do not enquire after the price, becauſe you think 'tis cheap, but do not deceive your ſelf, I aſſure you, I muſt have a Crown for every pound. The Shoomaker vext that ſhe queſtioned his thoughts and ability, with an angry tone ſaid to her, <hi>had it been very cheap, I would have had but one pound, but ſince 'tis dear, I'll have three,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:151523:117"/> he gives her three Crowns, and then thruſting down his little Hat (for you muſt know that the Tradeſmen wear them as narrow as the People of Quality wear them broad, and turning up his <hi>Muſtachios</hi> by way of Rodamentade, he rais'd the point of his formidable Sword almoſt to the top of his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and haughtily lookt at us, having well obſerv'd that we took notice of him and overheard his Diſcourſe and were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but the pleaſantneſs of the thing lies here, perhaps theſe three Crowns was all that ever this vain-glorious Fool had in the World, that this was his whole Weeks profit, and that to morrow, himſelf, his Wife and poor Children, would have a more ſevere Faſt, than with Bread and Water; but ſuch is the vain humour of theſe People here; nay there are ſome of them which will take the legs of a Capon, and will let them hang down under their Cloaks, that they may look as if they really had a Capon, whilſt they have nothing but the Legs and Feet.</p>
               <p>You cannot ſee a Joyner, a Sadler, or other ſort of Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, without his Velvet and Sattin Suit like the Kings, with his long Rapier and Dagger, and his Guattar hung up in his Shop. They work as little as ever they can, for I have more than once told you, that they are naturally lazy. Indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>over-ruling Neceſſity</hi> drives them to do any thing at all, and then they work upon Sundays and other Feſtivals, without any ſcruple, as well as upon any other Day; and afterwards they carry their Goods abroad. If 'tis a Shoomaker and he has two Prentices, he takes them both with him, and each of them carry a Shooe, nay if he has three, they muſt all go along with him, and 'tis with much ado, that he'll ſtoop to try the Shooes he made; when he has done, he goes and ſits him down in the Sun (which is call'd the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Fire) with a Company of ſuch idle Fellows as himſelf, and there with a ſovereign Authority they determine matters of State, and ſettle the Intereſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; very often they fall out about them, ſome one of them that takes himſelf to be a more able Politician than the reſt, will have them yield to his Judgment, but another as conceited as himſelf will not ſubmit, and ſo they fall together by the Ears without Mercy. I was two days ago to ſee the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's Lady, and there was brought in thither a poor Wretch which was juſt then wounded in the Street; he was a Coſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and it ſeems had maintain'd that the <hi>Grand Senior</hi> would not be reckoned a cunning Politician if he did not cauſe his Brother to be ſtrangled; another to whom that young Prince was not ſo diſpleaſing, ſtood up in his defence, and thereupon theſe two fell a fighting; but after all, to give them their due,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:151523:117"/> all theſe People talk of Government and Politicks with a great deal of Judgment, and give good Reaſons for what they ſay.</p>
               <p>Here is in this City ſeveral Houſes which are a ſort of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, where People meets ſome to Play, and others for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. They play there with great honeſty, and let them loſe what Sum they will upon Honour, they never fail to pay it in twenty four hours. If there ſhould be any failure, their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation is for ever loſt. No Reaſon whatſoever will be admitted againſt the neceſſity of paying in that time. They play there very high and very fairly, without noiſe or ſhewing the leaſt vexation or concern: If they win, it is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to give the <hi>Barato;</hi> this I think is alſo us'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> that is to ſay, you give Money to thoſe that are preſent, to ſome more to others leſs, and this whether you know them or no. He to whom you preſent the <hi>Barato</hi> muſt never refuſe it, let him be a hundred times richer and better Quality than the Donour, nay one may demand it of a Gameſter that is winning, and he'll not deny to give it. There are People that have no other Subſiſtance than this; but yet this is no good Cuſtom, for though a Man does win, yet ſometimes he hardly carries any thing of his gains away with him, and if he begins to play again, he often loſes his own.</p>
               <p>Further, if a Man is found to have cheated, he has as good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to forſake all Company; for no honeſt Perſon will have any thing to do with him, and if he is taken in the fact, he may think himſelf happy if he comes off with ſome <hi>Cuchillades,</hi> that is, ſome Cuts, but not Thruſts with a Sword.</p>
               <p>As to the Converſation in theſe Academies, there's of it that is very ingenious, and very knowing Perſons that frequent them; for in a word, they are here juſt as in other Places, and there are ſome that write very fine things. What they call <hi>Novels</hi> ſeem to me to be of a Stile, and to have an Air that charms; they never advance any thing but what's probable, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they take is ſo well manag'd, and their Narration ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and plain, neither mean nor lofty, that one muſt needs grant they have a Genius, which ſurpaſſes all others, in theſe ſort of pieces. I will endeavour to get ſome of this kind, and will tranſlate and ſend them to you, that ſo you may judge of them your ſelf. As I have not capacity enough to ſpeak of things which treat of more ſublime matters, ſo ſhall I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them till I have been inform'd by thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, and then I ſhall only pretend to be their Eccho. But after all I muſt needs ſay, that I think them extravagant in their Elogies, and that in them they keep not near to probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, their Imagination, which is very lively and active, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:151523:118"/> runs too faſt. I was t'other day reading in a Book, where ſpeaking of <hi>Philip</hi> the VI. the Author ſaid, that his Vertues and great Qualities were ſo many, that there was not Paper enough in the World to write them down; that a common Pen was not worthy to deſcribe ſuch divine things, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be writ by the Rays of the Sun upon the ſurface of the Heavens. You'll grant me that this is really loſing a Mans ſelf in the Clouds, and that with endeavouring to exalt his <hi>Hero,</hi> our poor Author falls and breaks his own neck. Their Books are very ill printed, rheir Paper is not white, and they are very ill bound, being cover'd with Parchment or Sheep-skin Leather.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget to tell you one thing, and 'tis very material, and that is the Policy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which perſwades them rather to be at the charge of a hundred falſe Informations, than to neglect the Opportunity of receiving one true Advice: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſtance of the Country from whence they come, nor their Agents, are ſuſpected by them, they will know every thing and liberally recompenſe thoſe that ſerve them, nay they'll hardly tarry till the Service is accepted, before they will reward them. You cannot believe how much advantage this Maxim has gain'd them, they have been ſometimes taken for Fools, but that has not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them, and in the end they always had what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. It is likewiſe true, that though they have but very ſlender ground to beg a favour of the King, yet provided they are not diſheartned with Repulſes, but purſue their firſt Deſign with Perſeverance, ſooner or later they obtain what they wiſht for. The Miniſters of State think 'tis not ſuitable to the Grandeur of ſo mighty a Monarch to refuſe a ſmall matter; and tho there's but little Juſtice in pretending to a favour which one has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome Service, yet if it is ſued for without intermiſſion, it is always obtain'd. I ſee Examples of it every day.</p>
               <p>I have not yet told you, dear Couſin, that upon my Arrival here, all the Ladies did me the Honour to viſit me firſt. It is the Cuſtom here to prevent Strangers, when once they know they are of Quality and their good Conduct, concerning both which they are very nice. When I return'd them their Viſit, every one made me a Preſent; ſometimes in one Houſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Dozen, for even the Children of four Years old will treat you. I was preſented with great Baskets of gilt Silver, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Corral curiouſly wrought in Flowers; theſe are made at <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millan:</hi> I had alſo Amber Boxes ſet with Gold, ennammell'd and full of Paſtils; divers preſented me with Gloves and with Silk-Stockings and Garters in abundance; but theſe Gloves are ſingular, in that they are as ſhort as the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:151523:118"/> Mens, for the Women wear their Sleeves down to their Wriſts, the Fingers are ſo long that they look as if they were nothing elſe, and are ridiculous: The Stockings are made of <hi>Polo,</hi> that is raw Silk; they are made ſo ſhort and ſo little in the Foot, that I have ſeen ſeveral Babies that they would not fit; the Garters are of a broad Ribbond, made very light and thin, like thoſe our <hi>Peaſants</hi> give at their Weddings; they are trim'd at each end with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Thread Lace. They preſented me alſo with ſeveral Cups of that Mineral Earth, and a thouſand other things of this kind. If ever I go from hence, and make another Journey hither, it will be my turn to preſent: But alaſs! any thing pleaſes them, Needles, Pins, a little Ribbond, but above all, any thing made of their falſe Stones raviſhes them with Joy; they that have ſo many that are right and ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet wear a prodigious quantity of theſe falſe ones, which in reality are nothing neither, but bitts of Glaſs ſett, and juſt like thoſe our Chimney-ſweepers ſell to our <hi>Provincials,</hi> who never ſaw more than their <hi>Curate</hi> and their Flock. The Ladies of the greateſt Quality are loaded with theſe falſe Stones, which they buy at dear rates; and when I askt them why they were ſo fond of theſe conterfeit Diamonds, they told me it was becauſe they could have of them as big as they deſir'd. And indeed they have of them in their Pendants, as big as an Egg, and all theſe come to them either from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> for as I have told you, few things are made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> Idleneſs reigns too much there.</p>
               <p>There's no good Painters in this City, the greateſt part of thoſe that draw, are not of this Country; they are either <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Italians</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> which come and ſettle here; but yet they do not grow rich, for Money does not come and move in the circle of Trade. For my part, I muſt needs ſay, I never ſaw leſs ſtirring. My Kinſwoman receives pretty conſiderable Sums all in <hi>Quartos;</hi> it is <hi>Copper</hi> Money, and as naſty as our <hi>Doubles;</hi> but as bad as 'tis, yet it com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ut of the <hi>Royal</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; it is deliver'd by Weight (for how is't poſſible to count ſuch ſorry ſtuff?) and Men bring it upon their backs in great matted Baskets; when theſe ſort of Payments come, the whole Houſe is employ'd for eight days together in taking an Account of theſe <hi>Quartos,</hi> in three or four thouſand Crowns, there's not a hundred Piſtols, either in Gold or Silver.</p>
               <p>They have here great numbers of Slaves, which are bought and ſold at great rates, theſe are <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> there are ſome of them worth four or five hundred Crowns; heretofore they had power of Life and Death over them, a <hi>Patron</hi> might
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:151523:119"/> have killed his Slave as he might have kill'd a Dog; but it was thought that theſe Barbarities did not agree with the Maxims of the Chriſtian Religion, and now that Practice is forbid; but yet they beat them till they cripple them, without ever being call'd to account for't. It's true, there are but few Maſters that are thus ſevere; and if a Man happen to love his female Slave, and ſhe grants his deſires, ſhe becomes immediately free. As to the other Domeſticks, it would be ſomewhat dangerous to uſe them ill; they pretend for the moſt part, to be of as good Families as the Maſters they ſerve; and if they ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd, they would be in a capacity to revenge themſelves, either by Treacherouſly Murdering, or Poyſoning of them; there are many Examples of this, they ſay, that a Man ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over them, becauſe they are poor, that though they are reduced to ſerve, yet they have not renounc'd their Honour; and that they ſhould forfeit it, if they ſhould take blows from any body whatever.</p>
               <p>The Beggars are even proud, and when they ask an Alms, it is in an imperious and domineering way; if one refuſes them, it muſt be done civilly, in ſaying to them, <hi>Cavallero, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, uſted, no tenga moneda;</hi> that is, Pardon me <hi>Cavallero,</hi> I have no Money. If you give them a rough Denial, they'll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to argue with you, and undertake to prove to you, that that you do not deſerve that Eſtate God has bleſt you with, and will never let you alone; but if one ſpeaks courteouſly to them, they ſeem well enough content and deſiſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are naturally gentle and kind; they marry their Slaves, and if it be with another Slave, the Children they have are not free, but like their Fathers, are ſubject to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron;</hi> but if theſe Children marry, their Iſſue ſhall not be Slaves. And ſo it is, if a Woman Slave marry a Free-man, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren follow the Condition of the Father. One is mighty well ſerv'd by theſe unhappy Wretches; they are far more diligent, laborious and humble than other Servants; there are few of them that will change their Religion. I have one that is not above nine years old; ſhe is as black as Jett, and would be reckon'd in her own Country a wonderful Beauty, for her Noſe is quite flat, her Lips prodigiouſly thick, her Eyes of a white and red colour, and her Teeth admirable, in <hi>Europe</hi> as well as in <hi>Africa.</hi> She underſtands not a word of any other Language than her own; her Name is <hi>Zayde,</hi> we have got her baptized; this young Chriſtian has been ſo us'd to throw off her white Mantle, and to be quite naked when ſhe was expos'd to ſale, that I have had much ado to hinder her from doing ſo now;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:151523:119"/> and t'other day, when we had a great deal of Company, I ſent for her; and truly Mrs. <hi>Zayde</hi> was pleas'd to appear before them all with her little black Body as naked as ſhe was born. I am reſolved to have her whipt, to make her know that this ſort of faſhion does not pleaſe me, for there is no other way to make her underſtand. Thoſe that ſold her to me, told me ſhe was a Girl of <hi>Quality,</hi> and the poor Child will come often and fall down on her Knees before me, hold her hands together, cry, and point towards her Country; I would willingly ſend her thither, if ſhe could there be a Chriſtian; but this impoſſibility obliges me to keep her. I would fain underſtand her, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe is witty, all her Actions ſhew it; ſhe dances after her faſhion, and 'tis ſo pleaſantly, that ſhe makes us very merry. I make her wear white Patches, with which ſhe is mightily taken. She is dreſt as they are at <hi>Moroco,</hi> that is, with a ſhort Gown almoſt without any plights, great Shift-ſleeves of fine Cloth, ſtrip'd with different colours, like thoſe of our <hi>Bohemians</hi> or <hi>Gypſies;</hi> a pair of Stays which are only made of a ſlip of Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Velvet with a gold ground, and are made faſt at the ſides with ſilver Buckles and Buttons, and a Mantle of very fine white woollen ſtuff, very large and long, in which ſhe wraps her ſelf, and with one corner of it covers her Head. This dreſs is handſome enough; her ſhort Hair, which looks like Wool, is cut in ſeveral places, on each ſide like a Half-moon, on the the Crown a Circle, and before a Heart; ſhe coſt me twenty <hi>Piſtols,</hi> my Daughter hath made her Governeſs of her <hi>Marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett;</hi> it is the little Monkey which the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> preſented to her. I do aſſure you, that <hi>Zayde</hi> and the <hi>Marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett</hi> are well met, and underſtand one another very well.</p>
               <p>But to come to other things, here's arriv'd a Man which has been fetch'd from the fartheſt parts of <hi>Galicia;</hi> he is ſuch a Saint, that he has done many Miracles, as 'tis pretended. The Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> heretofore Governeſs of the King, was like to dye, and ſhe ſent to have him come in all haſte, but they were ſo long upon the Journey, that ſhe was well again before he came. It was known what day he would arrive, and while ſhe was then expecting him, <hi>Don Fernand de Tolleda,</hi> who is her Nephew, and had not ſeen her ſince his return from <hi>Flanders,</hi> becauſe of her having been ſick; knowing that ſhe was then much better, happen'd to go to her Houſe much about the time the Saint of <hi>Galitia</hi> was to be there. The Marchioneſs's People ſeeing him, and not knowing him at all, (for he had been abſent ſeveral years) without conſidering that there were few Men of his Age and Looks ſo happy as to work Miracles,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:151523:120"/> concluded, at firſt ſight, that he was the Saint: immediately they threw open the great door, and rung the Bell for the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as the Marchioneſs had order'd them; all the <hi>Duennas</hi> and the Maids came to receive him with every one a Wax-Candle in her hand; ſeveral of them fell upon their Knees, and would not let him ſtir till he had given them his bleſſing. He thought they made a fool of him, to give him ſuch a reception; he knew not whether he was bewitch'd, or whether he dreamt; and do what he could, he could not perſwade himſelf that all this was real; it was to no purpoſe to talk to them, they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not at all, the noiſe and the crowd was ſo great; they brought their Beads to touch him, and thoſe that were far off him, threw them at his Head, with a hundred Medals faſten'd to them. The moſt zealous began to cut his Cloak and his Cloaths; and now his fear began to be very great, leſt through a deſire to multiply his <hi>Relicks,</hi> they did not cut him to pieces. The Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Veloz,</hi> who was carried between four in a great Elbow-Chair, came to meet the Holy Man: and truly when ſhe perceiv'd the miſtake, and ſaw it was her Nephew, ſhe fell a laughing ſo loud and ſo long, that ſhe far exceeded the ſtrength every body thought ſhe had. When he came from her Houſe, he came to ſee us, all torn, and juſt as the devout People had left him.</p>
               <p>I ſhould tell you, that all is mighty private and retir'd in this Court; but here's the way and manner how ſome particular Perſons live: In the Morning as ſoon as they are up, they drink Water cool'd with Ice, and preſently after Chocolate; when Dinner-time is come, the Maſter ſits down to Table, his Wife and Children, as I have already obſerv'd, eat upon the Floor near the Table; this is not done out of reſpect, as they tell me, but the Woman cannot ſit upon a Chair, ſhe is not accuſtomed to it; and there are ſeveral ancient <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which never ſat upon one in their whole Life: they make a light meal, for they eat little fleſh; the beſt of their food are Pigeons, Pheaſants, and their <hi>Olio</hi>'s which are excellent; but the greateſt Lord has not brought to his Table above two Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and ſome very bad Ragou, full of Garlick and Pepper; and after that ſome Fennel and a little Fruit: when this little Dinner is over, every one in the Houſe undreſs themſelves, and lye down upon their Beds, upon which they lay <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Skins for coolneſs: at this time you ſhall not find a ſoul in the Streets; the Shops are ſhut, all Trade ceas'd, and it looks as if every body were dead. At two a Clock in the Winter, and at four in the Summer, they begin to dreſs themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151523:120"/> then eat Sweet-meats, drink either ſome Chocolate, or Waters cool'd in Ice, and afterwards every body goes where they think fit; and indeed they tarry out till eleven or twelve a Clock at Night, I ſpeak of People that live regularly. Then the Husband and Wife go to Bed, a great Table-Cloth is ſpread all over the Bed, and each faſtens it under their Chin; the <hi>He</hi> and <hi>She</hi> Dwarfs ſerve up Supper, which is as frugal as the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for it is either a Pheaſant Hen made into a Ragou, or ſome Paſtry bus'neſs, which burns the Mouth, it is ſo exceſſively pepper'd. The Lady drinks her belly full of Water, and the Gentleman very ſparingly of the Wine, and when Supper is ended, each goes to ſleep as well as they can.</p>
               <p>The unmarry'd, or thoſe who obſerve but few rules with their Wives, after they have been taking the Air in the <hi>Prado,</hi> where in Summer they go half naked in their Coaches; I mean when 'tis dark they get a light Supper, mount their Horſes, and take a Foot-man behind them, they do this that they may not loſe him; for going in the darkeſt Night through ſo many Streets very quick, how ſhould a Foot-man be able to turn and wind, and follow his Maſter? But they are alſo afraid of being aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind, the Footman having no other care than to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, is as it were the Sentinel, and is ready to defend his Maſter. There may be ſome which will do this, but moſt of them in ſuch caſes run away, for they are not ſtout. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal Ramble is upon the Ladies account, they then viſit them, and to gain an Empire, they would not negleſt that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. They talk to them through the Lattice of their Windows, ſometimes they go into their Gardens, and when they can into their Chambers. Their Paſſion is ſo violent, that they'll look the greateſt danger in the face; they'll go to the very place where the Husband ſleeps, and I have been told that they'll ſee one another years together, without daring to ſpeak one word, for fear of being heard. They are ignorant in <hi>France</hi> what 'tis to love at the rate theſe People are ſaid to love. And not to mention the cares, the earneſt deſires, the nicety, and the devoting of themſelves up even to death, (for the Husband and the Relations give no quarter) that which I admire, is their Fidelity and Secreſie. It is never known, that a <hi>Cavallero</hi> boaſts of having receiv'd Favours from a Lady; they ſpeak of their Miſtreſſes with ſo much reſpect and value, as if they were their Sovereigns. And on the other hand, theſe Ladies never deſire to oblige any other than their Gallants, they are entirely taken up with him; and although they cannot ſee him in the day-time, yet they have opportunity to employ ſeveral hours
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151523:121"/> about him, either in writing to, or ſpeaking of him with ſome ſhe Friend who is privy to the Intreague; or elſe in waiting all the day long, and looking through their Lattices to ſee him go by. In a word, upon all that I have been told about theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I can eaſily believe, that <hi>Love</hi> had its Birth in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>Cavalleros</hi> are with their Miſtreſſes, their Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men look after their Horſes at ſome diſtance from the Houſe; but there are very often unpleaſant Miſchances happen to them, for there being no neceſſary places in their Houſes, all night long they throw that out of their Windows, which decency hinders me from naming to you; ſo that the amorous <hi>Spaniard</hi> which goes ſilently along the Street, is many times in a naſty condition from head to foot; and though at his coming out he was curiouſly perfum'd, yet he is forc'd to return as faſt as he can to change his Cloths. This is one of the greateſt Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in this City, and which renders it ſo ſtinking and filthy, that in the Morning one can hardly paſs along the Streets. I ſay in the Morning, for the Air is here ſo ſubtile and hot, that all this naſtineſs is conſum'd before Noon. When a Horſe, or any other Animal dies, they throw him into the Street where he happens to be, though it were before the Pallace-Gate, and the next day you'll find him reduc'd to duſt. They are perſuaded, that if they did not throw out their Filth and Carrion in this manner into their Streets, <hi>Madrid</hi> would not be long without the Plague, and it never is there.</p>
               <p>But beſides thoſe ways I have now mention'd, that Gallants have to ſee their Miſtreſſes, they have yet others; for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies viſit one another frequently, and there is nothing more eaſie for them than to wear a Vail, and by the back door go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chair, and be carry'd where they will: And this is the more practicable, becauſe all the Women agree to keep one anothers Secrets inviolably, let there be what Differences there will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and let them never be ſo angry one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they never open their lips to make the leaſt Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; their Diſcretion cannot be ſufficiently prais'd: It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the conſequences would be more fatal if they did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſince they make nothing here of murthering upon a bare Suſpicion.</p>
               <p>After this manner, the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ies make their Viſits to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you muſt not go to ſee your Friend when you have a mind, you muſt tarry till you are deſir'd to come, and the Lady that has a mind to be viſited, writes a Letter in the Morning, and invites you, you are carry'd in a Chair which is extream <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> every way, and that they may be the lighter, they are
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:151523:121"/> made only of a thin ſtuff hung upon a wooden frame, theſe ſtuffs are always mixt with Gold and Silver, and are very rich; they have in them three great Glaſſes, and the top is made of a very thin Leather, lin'd as the reſt, and it opens upwards that ſo one may go in and out more conveniently; to every Chair there's four Bearers, which relieve one another, and a Footman carries the Hat of the foremoſt; for let it be what Weather it will, he muſt not be cover'd before his Miſtreſs. The Lady is ſet as faſt in her Chair, as a Diamond-ſtone in a Ring; ſhe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wears no Mantle or Vail then, or if ſhe does, it has a black <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lace ſet on it, half an Ell deep very fine and dear; this is becoming enough: ſhe has alſo a Coach with four Mules in thoſe long Traces I have formerly mentioned, which follows ſoftly after the Chair, that is commonly fill'd with old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-Uſhers, and five or ſix Pages; for every body has theſe, my Banker's Wife has two. The Ladies never take any of their Women with them; and though ſeveral of them are going the ſame place, yet they each of them take a Chair to themſelves, and do not go together in any one of their Coaches. I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd t'other day, to be in a ſtop there was in a Street, and there came by me fifty Chairs, and as many Coaches one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they came out of the Dutcheſs <hi>De Frias,</hi> and went to the Dutcheſs <hi>D' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zeda</hi>'s Houſe, I'll tell you why they went thither, when I have firſt told you that when the Lady is come to her Houſe whom ſhe goes to viſit, the Chairmen carry her as far as the Anti-chamber, the Stairs are made purpoſely very wide and low, for the greater eaſe, aſſoon as ſhe is ſet down, ſhe ſends away all her People and her Coach, and appoints them what hour to come and fetch her home, which is uſually between ten and eleven a Clock, for their Viſits are long enough to tire the greateſt Patience.</p>
               <p>There never comes any Men where they are met, a jealous Husband would have little to do to ſeek his Wife among them; he would be laught at, and they would not vouchſafe to give him any other Satisfaction, than telling him, <hi>That ſhe is where he is not.</hi> The good Women are cunning enough, and they make uſe of this liberty; for you muſt know that every Houſe has its back doors, by which they can ſteal out, and never be ſeen. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, every one has a Brother at her Siſters, a Son at her Mothers, or a Nephew at her Aunts, and this is another pretence they make uſe of to ſee their Lover. Love in this Country is very ingenious, nothing is neglected to gratifie their Paſſion, and the Miſtreſs meets with Fidelity; there are Intrigues that laſt one's Life, and yet there has not been an hours time loſs to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:151523:122"/> accompliſh them, all Opportunities are improv'd, and there needs no more after ſeeing and liking one another.</p>
               <p>I was ſome days ago at the Marchioneſs <hi>D' Alcannizas,</hi> ſhe's one of the greateſt and moſt vertuous Ladies of the Court; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of theſe things, ſhe very freely ſaid to us, I muſt needs confeſs, that if a <hi>Cavallero</hi> ſhould be convenienly alone with me half an hour, and did not ask me all that a Man could ask, I ſhould reſent it ſo briskly, that I would ſtab him if I could. And would you grant him all the Favours he might ask you, interrupted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>De Liche,</hi> who is young and handſome? That does not follow, replied my Lady <hi>D' Alcannizas,</hi> on the contrary, I have reaſon to believe, that I ſhould grant him nothing at all; but then I could not reproach him with any thing, whereas if he made no attempt upon me, I ſhould conclude he deſpiſed me. There are few, I believe, but what are of the ſame opinion in this matter.</p>
               <p>There's one thing I find very odd, and not to look well, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks in a Catholick Kingdom, and that is, The tollerating of Men, that keep Miſtreſſes ſo openly, without the leaſt diſguiſe; it is very true that they are forbid by the Laws, but they value not the Laws, and only obey their own Inclinations, and yet no body offers to call them to account, or to reprove them in the leaſt. Theſe Miſtreſſes are called <hi>Amancebades;</hi> though a Man is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, yet he muſt have one of theſe Creatures, and often the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Children are brought up with the <hi>legitimate</hi> in the ſight of the poor Wife, who patiently bears all this without ſo much as ſpeaking a word. It is very ſeldom one hears of any Differences between Husband and Wife, and yet ſeldomer, that they ſeparate as in <hi>France.</hi> Of an infinite number of Perſons that I know here, I have only ſeen the Princeſs <hi>Della Rocea,</hi> that does not live with her Husband, but in a <hi>Convent,</hi> the Courts of Juſtice are not much troubled here with domeſtick Quarrels.</p>
               <p>It ſeems extraordinary to me that a Lady who loves, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by a <hi>Cavallero,</hi> is not jealous of his <hi>Amancebada;</hi> ſhe looks upon her as a ſecond Wife, and believes ſhe cannot ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with her; ſo that a Man has his <hi>Wife,</hi> his <hi>Amancebade,</hi> and his Miſtreſs, this laſt is generally a Perſon of Quality; 'tis ſhe that is viſited in the Night, and for whom they venture their Lives.</p>
               <p>It happens ſometimes that a Lady cover'd with her great plain Mantle or Vail, and not ſhewing any more of her Face than half an Eye, and being ordinarily dreſt, becauſe ſhe would not be known, and having no mind to take a Chair, walks afoot to the place of Rendezvous; either her being little us'd to walk, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, her manner and way diſtinguiſhes her: a <hi>Cavallero</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and begins to talk to her, uneaſie to have ſuch a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:151523:122"/> which it is hard to get rid of, ſhe addreſſes her ſelf to the firſt ſhe meets, and without further diſcovery of her ſelf, I conjure you, ſays ſhe to him, to hinder this importunate Man to follow me any longer, his curioſity may injure my affairs; this Requeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a command with a brave <hi>Spaniard;</hi> he asks him againſt whom the Lady complains, why he will preſs upon her againſt her mind, and if he meets with an obſtinate Perſon, the Sword muſt be drawn, and ſometimes they kill each other, without knowing for whom they have ſo expos'd themſelves. In the mean while, the Lady makes the beſt of her way, leaves them fighting together, and goes where ſhe's expected; but the jeſt is, that very often this proves either to be the Husband or the Brother that aſſerts her Cauſe, and by defending her from the Purſuit of the inquiſitive, gives her an Opportunity to enjoy the embraces of her Gallant.</p>
               <p>Some time ago, a young Lady who dearly lov'd her Husband, being inform'd that he did not live ſo regularly as he ſhould, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd her ſelf, put on her Vail, and ſtanding in a Street he us'd often to paſs through, ſhe ſpy'd him and gave him an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſpeak to her. After he had occoſted her, ſhe began to <hi>thou</hi> him; and 'tis commonly in this familiar way that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this Country make known their Inclinations. He made a Propoſal to her, which ſhe accepted, but upon condition that he ſhould not be deſirous either to ſee her or know who ſhe was: he promiſed he would not, and ſo led her to a Friend of his; at their parting he aſſur'd her, that he thought himſelf the happieſt of Men, and that Fortune had never been ſo kind to him before, and then gave her a very fine Ring, and begged her to keep it for his ſake. I'll keep and love it dearly, and will meet <hi>thee</hi> here again when thou wilt, ſays ſhe to him, for I had as good have thy Jewels as another. When ſhe had ended theſe words, ſhe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Vail, and the Husband ſeeing 'twas his Wife, was in the greateſt confuſion imaginable at his Adventure; but he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that ſince ſhe had ſo well contriv'd the matter as to get out of her Houſe to watch him, ſhe might alſo find a way to play him ſome other trick leſs pleaſant; and therefore to be ſecure of her, he appointed two <hi>Duennas</hi> conſtantly to look after her, and they never after left her.</p>
               <p>It happens alſo ſometimes, that when a Man's Houſe is not near the Place, where by chance he meets his Miſtreſs, he goes without Ceremony into the next he comes at, whether he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted there or no, he civilly intreats the Maſter to let him have a Room to himſelf, becauſe he has now an Opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with a Lady, which if he loſes, he ſhall not have the like in a long time; this is enough to make the Maſter grant an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:151523:123"/> to the Gallant and his Miſtreſs, and ſometimes, I aſſure you, 'tis the very Wife of the Fool that goes away ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in a word, they will venture ſtrangely for an Opportunity of ſeeing each other, though but for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>I remember a <hi>French</hi> Lady, diſcourſing of a certain Man to one of her Friends, ſaid, <hi>Shew me an amorous Man, and I'll ſhew you one ruin'd.</hi> This Maxim is verifi'd here, more than in any place in the World; a Lover or a Gallant has nothing that he can call his own. It is no matter whether ſhe either ſees, or has a real occaſion for a thing, 'tis ſufficient if ſhe does but barely deſire it, they are never deny'd any thing, and the manner of giving it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunſes their Liberality. I find them nothing near ſo amicable as our <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> but 'tis ſaid they know how to love at a greater rate. Beſides, their Behaviour is a thouſand times more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nay this extends ſo far, that when a Man, let him be of what Quality he will, preſents any thing, or gives a Letter to a Lady, he kneels upon one knee, and he does the ſame, when he receives any thing from her hand.</p>
               <p>I ſaid I would tell you, why ſo many Ladies went to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>D' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zeda</hi>'s; ſhe is very amiable, and Daughter to the Duke <hi>D' Oſſone,</hi> her Husband has had a Quarrel with the Prince <hi>De Stillano,</hi> about a Lady which they both love; they drew their Swords, and 'tis like to be an ill buſineſs. The King has caus'd them to be arreſted, that is, they are not made Priſoners, but he has confin'd them to their Houſes; unleſs they privately go abroad in the Night to purſue their uſual amorous Pleaſures. And that which is ſtrange, the poor Wife muſt not ſet her foot out of door as long as her Husband is under theſe Confinements, though it is almoſt conſtantly for ſome piece of Infidelity he is guilty of towards her. And it is the ſame alſo, if they be baniſht, or ſent to remain upon ſome of their own Eſtates in the Country, which frequently happens. In all the time of their Abſence, their Wives keep houſe without ſo much as once going abroad. I have been told, that the Dutcheſs <hi>D' Oſſone,</hi> was a Priſoner after this manner for above two Years; this is the Cuſtom, but it makes ones Life very dull and tedious.</p>
               <p>But 'tis not only the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies, who are ſo tir'd and uneaſie here, the <hi>French</hi> find but little diverſion: We are in a few days to go to <hi>Arranjues</hi> and <hi>Tolledo</hi> to kiſs the Queen Mothers hand; I'll write you, dear Couſin, the particulars of that ſmall Journey, and I wiſh with all my Soul I were in a condition to give you more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential marks of my Affection.</p>

               <head>LETTER XIII.</head>
               <p>BY my laſt Letter, I told you, Dear Couſin, that we were to kiſs the Queen Mother's Hand; I have had this Honour, but before I conduct you thither, give me leave to tell you of ſomething elſe. I would not go from <hi>Madrid</hi> till I had ſeen the Entry of the Marquiſs <hi>De Villars;</hi> he made it on Horſe-back, which is the Cuſtom here, and if a Man be handſom, it is very advantagious for him: when the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador made his, it was happy for him that he was not in his Coach; he had one that was worth twelve thouſand Crowns, which in going from his Houſe was overturn'd, and as it was in Winter, the <hi>Marée</hi> (which is that naſty black dirt that ſtands in great puddles in the Streets, and through which a Horſe goes up to his Girts) ſo ſpoil'd the Velvet with a Gold ground, and the rich Embroidery it was ſet off with, that it could never ſerve again. I thought it ſtrange that for ſuch uſual Sights as theſe <hi>Entrees</hi> are, the Ladies ſhould all be in their Balconies, in their rich Apparel, and with the ſame earneſtneſs, as if it was to ſee the greateſt King upon earth; but they have ſo little liberty, that they are glad to embrace all Occaſions to ſhew themſelves; and as their Lovers and Gallants hardly ever ſpeak to them, ſo they take care to place their Coaches as near their Miſtreſſes Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as they can, that ſo they may the more eaſily diſcourſe with them by their Eyes and their Fingers; this is a Practice that is very uſeful to them for the underſtanding one anothers Minds, and they do it more readily than with their Voice, this ſilent Language ſeems to me very difficult unleſs one were long us'd to it; but they are early acquainted with it, and but two days ſince, I ſaw a Girl of about ſix years old and a Boy of the ſame Age, which underſtood by this way to tell one another a thouſand pretty things. <hi>Don Frederick De Cordonna,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them as well as I, but underſtood them far better, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me every thing they ſaid; and if he did not add to the Diſcourſe of theſe two Children, one muſt needs confeſs, that in this Country, they are born for <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Courtſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marchioneſs <hi>De Palacio,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Don Fernand de Tolleda,</hi> is one of my Kinſwoman's beſt Friends; ſhe has a fine Houſe call'd <hi>Igarica,</hi> upon the Banks of <hi>Xarama,</hi> and though
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:151523:124"/> this Lady is now very old, yet ſhe never was there, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is but eight leagues from <hi>Madrid.</hi> It is not lookt upon in this Country to be according to Grandeur to go viſit their Lands, except they lie in ſome Principality or ſome City, and then they call them by the Name of their <hi>State.</hi> I chid this Lady for her Careleſneſs, and my Kinſwoman engag'd her to make one in the Company of her Daughter <hi>Donna Mariguita,</hi> who is a little Woman, pale, fat and fair; theſe three Qualities are equally rare here, and ſhe's admir'd by every body that ſees her; the young Marchioneſs <hi>De la Roſa,</hi> would alſo be of our Company, her Husband, with <hi>Don Fernand de Tolleda, Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, Sarmiento,</hi> and <hi>Eſteve de Carvajal,</hi> went on Horſeback; <hi>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</hi> would not have fail'd of being there too, had not the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> writ him to come to him in all haſte: when he told it me, I deſir'd him to go ſee the fair Marchioneſs <hi>De Los Rios alas Huelgas.</hi> I gave him a Letter for her, in which I taxt her with her ſilence, and deſir'd to know particularly how all things went. We ſet forward in two Coaches the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at ten a Clock at Night, in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Weather that could be; the Heats were ſo exceſſive, that unleſs one would venture their Lives, it was impoſſible to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in the day-time; but the Nights are cool, and the Coaches are in the Summer all open; the ſides of the Coach were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up quite round, with fine large Holland Curtains, trim'd with fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bone-lace, and ty'd with Knots of colour'd Ribbond, and as they often change them, they look very neat. We went ſo ſwift, that I was almoſt dead with fear leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about our Coach ſhould break; for it is certain, that we might have been all kill'd a hundred times over, before the Coachman would have known any thing of the matter. I fancy they run ſo, to make amends for their ſlow going in <hi>Madrid;</hi> for even the Foot-pace of the Mules is too quick there, becauſe of the ill pavement, the holes, the dirt in Winer, and the duſt in Summer, with which the Streets are extreamly troubled. The Marchioneſs <hi>De Palacios</hi> wore a little Hat, trim'd with Feathers, according to the mode of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies when they go into the Country; and the Marchioneſs <hi>De la Roſa</hi> lookt very pretty in her ſhort cloſe-coat, ſtrait ſleeves, and her other Ornaments, upon ſight of which, we cried out, that we thought her <hi>Muy Bizzarra,</hi> and <hi>Muy de Gala,</hi> that is, very gallant and very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did.</p>
               <p>It was very odd methinks, that theſe Ladies ſhould oblige us in three ſeveral Places upon the Road to alight out of our Coach, and hear the Marchioneſs <hi>de la Roſa</hi>'s two Gentlemen
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151523:124"/> play upon the Guittar, whom it ſeems they brought on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and it was pretty comical to ſee theſe Blades gallop with their Guittars hanging behind their Backs. This ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of Muſick was nevertheleſs raviſhing to them, and they were extreamly charm'd with the pleaſantneſs of the Country in ſo fine a Night. Indeed, I never ſaw Women ſo infinitely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd. We arrived at <hi>Arranjues</hi> about five a Clock in the Morning, and I was amaz'd at its wonderful Situation; half a League on this ſide the <hi>Tagus</hi> we paſs'd over a wodden Bridge, which is made to ſhut up; and after that we came into ſome Walks of Elme and Lyme Trees, which were ſo high, green and ſhady, that the heat of the Sun is never felt. It is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing to find ſo near <hi>Madrid,</hi> Trees ſo perfect in their kind, for the Soyl is very barren, and they will not grow there; but yet near <hi>Arranjues,</hi> one cannot perceive this defect I ſpeak of, for all along the Walks, and near the Trees, there are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pits and Trenches made, into which the Water of <hi>Tagus</hi> runs and moyſtens the roots of the Trees. Theſe Avenues are ſo long, that when one is in the middle, one cannot ſee to the end of 'em. Several Alleys come into theſe, and every way make the perfect figure of a Star. People walk on the Banks of the <hi>Tagus</hi> and <hi>Xamara,</hi> which are two famous Rivers that environ the Iſland in which <hi>Arranjues</hi> ſtands, and which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with Water, and extreamly contributes to its beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To ſpeak truly, I never ſaw a more delightful place; I muſt confeſs the Gardens are too cloſe, and ſeveral of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys too narrow, but yet it raviſhes one to walk there; and at our coming into them, I fancy'd my ſelf in ſome enchanted Palace. The Morning was cool, every where the Birds made a ſweet Melody, and the Waters a pleaſant murmuring noiſe, the Trees and Hedges were loaden with excellent Fruit, and the <hi>Parterres</hi> were cover'd with moſt odoriferent Flowers, and I enjoy'd all this in moſt pleaſant Company. We had an Order from <hi>Don John</hi> to be lodg'd in the Caſtle, ſo that the <hi>Alcade</hi> receiv'd us with great Civility, and was very careful to ſhew us every thing that was the moſt remarkable. The Fountains are in that number, and there are ſo very many of them, that it is impoſſible to paſs through an Alley, to go into an Arbor, or upon a <hi>Patere</hi> or Terraſs without taking notice of five or ſix with braſen Statues, and marble Baſins: The Spouts throw up their Water to a vaſt height, they are not fed from Springs, but from the <hi>Tagus.</hi> Amongſt others, I'll give you an account of the Fountain of <hi>Diana;</hi> It ſtands upon an aſcent, from whence it is ſeen at a great diſtance; the Goddeſs is in the midſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:151523:125"/> with Bucks, Does, and Dogs, and every one of them ſpouts out Water. A litttle lower is a circle of Myrrh, cut in ſeveral faſhions, and little <hi>Cupids</hi> peeping out half way, and throw the Water againſt thoſe Animals which ſtand about the Fountain. The Mountain of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> raiſes up its head in the midſt of a great Pond, with <hi>Apollo,</hi> the <hi>Muſes, Pagaſſius</hi>'s Horſe, and a fall of Water which repreſents the River of <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi> Out of a Rock there iſſues out a thouſand ſeveral Spouts of Water, ſome lanching out, others winding in and out like a Serpent upon the Surface of the Pond; ſome gliding gently, and others, either falling like Flowers in the Air, or elſe like Rain. The Fountain of <hi>Ganymedes</hi> is alſo very pretty, this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Child ſitting upon <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Eagle, ſeems frighted with its flight; the Bird ſits on the top of a Pillar with its Wings ſpread; he throws out the Water by his Beak and his Tallons; the Fountain of <hi>Mars</hi> is near this: That of the <hi>Harpyes</hi> is fine, they are placed upon very high Marble Pillars; at the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they throw out Water every way, they ſeem to have a mind to drown a little Youth who ſits in the middle of the Fountain, picking a Thorn out of his Foot. But the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of all is, the Fountain of <hi>Love;</hi> this little God ſeems to riſe with his Body all full of Darts, from every one of which comes out a Spout of Water. The three <hi>Graces</hi> ſit at the Feet of the <hi>God of Love;</hi> but that which is moſt extraordinary, is the Water which falls from four high Trees like Fountains, whoſe noiſe is very delighful and ſurprizing, it not being natural for Water to come out of Trees.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be afraid to tire you, did I undertake to tell you the vaſt number of Cataracts, Falls, and Fountains of Water which I have ſeen here, I will only in general aſſure you, that it is a Place worthy of the curioſity and attention of every body. At eight a Clock the Sun began to be too hot, and ſome went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe, which comes far ſhort of that Beauty it ſhould have, juſtly to anſwer all the other things; and when the King goes there, thoſe that attend him are ſo ill accommodated with Lodging, that either he muſt be contented to go there in all haſte, and keep his Court a little, or elſe go as far as <hi>Tolleda;</hi> for there are only two bad Inns, and a very few private Houſes. If we had not taken care before hand for Proviſions, even to Bread, I am confident we had met with none, unleſs the <hi>Alcade</hi> would have given us ſome of his. And by the way, I'll inform you the difference there's between the <hi>Alcade</hi> and <hi>Alcalde,</hi> that ſo you may not confound them; the firſt ſignifies the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a Caſtle or Place, and the other a Serjeant. Although
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:151523:125"/> the moſt curious Pictures are at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> yet I found ſome excellent ones in the King's Appartment at <hi>Arranjues;</hi> it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht according to the Seaſon we are now in, that is to ſay, the Walls are all white, have only a Matt that is very fine and thin about three foot deep with ſome Looking-glaſſes and Pictures. In this Building there are divers little Courts, which takes from the grace of it. We eat our Breakfaſt all together, and they perſwaded me to eat ſome of a Fruit they call <hi>Pimento,</hi> which is as long as one's finger, but as hot as Pepper, the leaſt bit of which puts ones Mouth in a Flame, they let it lie ſteeping in Vinegar and Salt, to get out the Virtue: this Fruit is brought into <hi>Spain</hi> growing upon a Plant; and I never ſaw any of it in other Countrys where I have been. We had an <hi>Ollio,</hi> ſome Ragous made of cold Partridges with Oyl, Canary Wine, fat Pullets, and Pigeons which are excellent here, and alſo ſeveral ſorts of Fruit, which was extraordinary fair. When this Repaſt, which was worth a Dinner, was ended, we went to Bed, and went not a walking till about ſeven a Clock in the Evening. The Charms of this Place were as new to me as if I had not ſeen them in the Morning, but particularly, I ſtill admir'd the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which indeed raviſhes, on what ſide ſoever one turns the Eyes. The King is there, with half a dozen of his Guards, in great ſafety, becauſe there's no getting at him but over Bridges, which are all drawn up, and the <hi>Xamara,</hi> which in this Place, ſwells the Waters of <hi>Tagas,</hi> fortifies <hi>Arranjus.</hi> After we had walkt till ten a Clock at Night, we came back into a great Hall, pav'd with Marble, and ſupported with Pillars of the ſame. It was all enlightned with divers brancht Candleſticks, and <hi>Don Eſteve de Carvajal</hi> had privately got thither ſeveral Muſicians, which were a pleaſant ſort of a ſurprize to us, at leaſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ladies and my Kinſwoman were mightily delighted with them. For my part, I thought they ſung too much in the Throat, and their Diviſions and Shakes were ſo long, that they were tedious; not but that their Voices are good, but their manner of ſinging is not good, and generally the greateſt part in <hi>Spain,</hi> do not ſing as they do in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> When Supper was done, we went to the great Canal, where there's a ſmall <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> painted and gilt, we went aboard her, and tarry'd till two a Clock in the Morning, and then we ſet forward on our way to <hi>Tolleda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I took notice when we came out of <hi>Arranjues,</hi> that the Ground was all Heath and Ling, and yet the Air was perfum'd with wild and mother Tyme, with which theſe Plains were all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. They told me there were a great many Rabits, Stags,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:151523:126"/> Does, and Fallow Deer, but it was not then their time to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Our Converſation was for ſometime general, and for two Leagues together from <hi>Arranjues,</hi> I did not ſpeak one word to <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> thô he ſat juſt cloſe by me; But being willing to imploy the time, in thoroughly informing my ſelf about all the Particulars of the cruel <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which he had promis'd to acquaint me with, I deſir'd him to let me know ſomething of it,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> ſays he, has not been known in <hi>Europe,</hi> but ſince the beginning of the Thirteenth Century. Before that time, the Biſhops and <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrates, enquir'd after <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and either condemn'd them to Baniſhment, or to the Forfeiture of their Goods and Eſtates, or elſe, to ſome other Penalties, which never almoſt extended to <hi>Death:</hi> But the vaſt number of <hi>Hereſies</hi> which appear'd towards the end of the Twelfth Age, caus'd that Tribunal to be Eſtabliſh'd: The <hi>Pope</hi> ſent ſeveral <hi>Religious</hi> Perſons to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to exhort them, to take an extraordinary care, in the Extirpation of <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and to bring obſtinate <hi>Hereticks</hi> to puniſhments: and thus things continued till the Year 1250.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1251. <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. Authoriz'd the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryars with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to take Cognizance of theſe ſort of Crimes. <hi>Clement</hi> the IV. confirm'd theſe Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in the Year 1265. Afterward, there were ſeveral Courts erected in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Kingdoms which were dependants of the Crown of <hi>Arragon,</hi> till ſuch time, that the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> was eſtabliſh'd in the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> and after that in <hi>Portugal,</hi> by King <hi>John</hi> the III. in the Year 1557.</p>
               <p>To that time the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> had a limited Power, and it was often conteſted by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to whom the Cognizance of <hi>Heritical</hi> Crimes belong'd. According to the <hi>Canons,</hi> it was contrary to the Rules of the <hi>Church,</hi> for <hi>Prieſts</hi> to ſentence any Criminals to <hi>Death,</hi> much more for thoſe Crimes, which the <hi>Civil</hi> Laws often puniſh'd, with far leſs ſevere Penalties: But ancient Right yielding to new Power, the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryars by the <hi>Popes</hi> Bulls have been for theſe two Ages, in poſſeſſion of this extraordinary Juriſdiction; from which the Biſhops have been excluded, the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> now only wanted the Authority of the <hi>Prince,</hi> to enable them to execute their Sentences. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Caſtille</hi> came to the Crown, the <hi>Dominican John de Torquemada,</hi> her Confeſſor, and afterward <hi>Cardinal,</hi> made her promiſe him to <hi>perſecute</hi> all <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as ſoon as it ſhould be in her Power to do ſo. She pervail'd over <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:151523:126"/> her Husband to obtain, in the Year 1483. <hi>Bulls</hi> from Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the IV. to conſtitute an <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> General, over the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> for theſe two Kingdoms were his <hi>Fee</hi> held in <hi>Capite:</hi> and it is to be noted, that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> diſpos'd of the Places in his Eſtates, and <hi>Iſabel</hi> of thoſe that were in hers: but the <hi>Queen</hi> got this Place for <hi>Torquemada.</hi> Afterwards the <hi>Pope</hi> extended his Juriſdiction over all the States and Countries of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Kings, and then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> eſtabliſht a Supream Council of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> of which they made him <hi>Preſident:</hi> It is compos'd of an <hi>Inquiſitor-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> (who is nominated by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and confirm'd by the <hi>Pope</hi>) of five Counſellors, whereof one is to be a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican,</hi> by a Priviledge granted to this Order, in the Year 1616. by <hi>Philip</hi> the III. Of a <hi>Procurator,</hi> two <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s Chamber, two Secretaries of the <hi>Council,</hi> an <hi>Algua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil Mayor,</hi> a Receiver, two Reporters, and two Qualificators. and Conſulters. The Number of the <hi>Familiars</hi> and ſmall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers is very great, becauſe all that belong to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſubject to or tryable by any other Juriſdiction, ſhelter themſelves here from the ordinary Courts of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Supream</hi> Council hath a full and ſole Authority over the other <hi>Inquiſitions,</hi> which cannot perform any <hi>Auto</hi> or Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without leave from the Great and General <hi>Inquiſitor:</hi> The particular <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Sevile, Tolleda, Grenada, Cordua, Cuenca, Vailladolid, Marcia, Derena, Logronno,</hi> St. <hi>James Saragoſſa, Valantia, Barcelona, Majorque, Sardaignia, Palermo, Canaries, Mexico, Cartagena,</hi> and <hi>Lima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one of theſe <hi>Inquiſitions</hi> is compos'd of three <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> three <hi>Secretaries,</hi> one <hi>Alguazil Mayor,</hi> and of three Receivers, Qualificators and Conſulters.</p>
               <p>All Perſons that take any of theſe Employments upon them, are oblig'd to make out their Proofs <hi>De caſa Limpia,</hi> that is, that their Family is not ſtain'd with any thing of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and that they are <hi>Catholicks</hi> from the beginning.</p>
               <p>The Proceedings of this Tribunal are very unuſual. A man is Arreſted and lies in Priſon, without knowing the Crime he is accus'd of, or the Witneſſes which depoſe againſt him: He cannot come out thence, unleſs he will own the Fault, of which often he is not guilty, and which the deſire of Liberty forces him to confeſs, for they do not put one to death for the firſt time; but then the Family is markt with Infamy, and this firſt Judgment makes the Perſons uncapable of any Employment.</p>
               <p>There's no confronting of Witneſſes, nor any means for a Man to defend himſelf, becauſe this Tribunal above all things
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:151523:127"/> affects an inviolable Secreſy. It proceeds againſt all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but chiefly againſt <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> and ſecret <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> of whom the Expulſion of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> has fill'd all <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeverity of this Court was ſo exceſſive, that the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor Torquemada</hi> try'd above a hundred thouſand Perſons, of which ſix thouſand were condemn'd to be Burnt in the compaſs of fourteen Years.</p>
               <p>It is pretended, that the ſight of ſo many Criminals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to ſo terrible a Death, without any regard either to their Sex or Quality confirms and keeps the People in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion, and that 'tis the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> alone, that has hindred the wickedeſt <hi>Hereſies</hi> from ſpreading themſelves in <hi>Spain,</hi> even in that time when all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides was infected with them. For this reaſon, the <hi>Kings</hi> have given ſuch Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Authority to this Tribunal, which is call'd the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Holy Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The general Acts of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which by the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> are lookt upon, only as a bare Execution of Criminals, amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> are eſteem'd a <hi>Religious</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony by which his <hi>Catholick</hi> Majeſty gives publick proofs of his <hi>Zeal</hi> for Religion. And therefore, are call'd by 'em <hi>Autos de Fé,</hi> or <hi>Acts of Faith;</hi> commonly they are perform'd either at the Acceſſion of the <hi>Kings</hi> to the Crown, or at their coming to Age, that ſo they may be the more Authentick: The laſt was in the Year 1632. and there is one now making ready for the <hi>King</hi>'s Marriage. As there has not been one of a long time, ſo there are great preparations making to render this as Solemn and as Magnificent as 'tis poſſible for thoſe ſorts of Ceremonies to be. One of the Counſellors of the Inquiſition has already drawn a Project of it, which he has ſhew'd me: Here's the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>great Place</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> there ſhall be a Theater erected fifty Foot long; It ſhall be rais'd as high as the Balcony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the <hi>King,</hi> and no higher.</p>
               <p>On the right-ſide of the <hi>King</hi>'s Balcony, quite croſs the Theater, there ſhall be rais'd an Amphitheater, of twenty five or thirty Steps, deſign'd for the Council of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and the other Councils of <hi>Spain,</hi> on the uppermoſt of which ſhall be placed the <hi>Chairs</hi> under a Canopy, for the <hi>General Inquiſitor</hi> a great deal higher then the <hi>King</hi>'s Balcony. On the left of the the Theater and the King's Balcony, there ſhall be another, Amphitheater as big as the firſt, upon which the Criminals ſhall be placed.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:151523:127"/>
               <p>In the middle of the great Theater, there ſhall be rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother very little one, on which ſhall be made two Cages, where the Criminals ſhall be kept while their Sentence is reading.</p>
               <p>There ſhall be likewiſe placed upon the great Theater, three Chairs for the Readers of the Judgment and for the Preacher, before whom there ſhall be an Altar erected.</p>
               <p>The Places for their <hi>Catholick</hi> Majeſties ſhall be ſo order'd, that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhall be on the left hand of the <hi>King,</hi> and on the right of the <hi>Queen-Mother.</hi> All the Queen's Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhall take up the reſt of the length every way of the ſame Balcony; there ſhall be other Balconies prepar'd for the Ambaſſadors, and Lords and Ladies of the Court, and Scaffolds for the People.</p>
               <p>The Ceremony ſhall begin by a Proceſſion from St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church. A hundred Charcoal-men arm'd with Pikes and Muskets, ſhall march before, becauſe they provide the Wood, which is to burn thoſe that are condemn'd to the Fire. Next them ſhall follow the <hi>Dominicans</hi> with a white Croſs carry'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> ſhall carry the Standard of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> according to a Priviledge that's Hereditary to his Family: This Standard is of red Damask, on one ſide of it, is repreſented a naked Sword, in a Crown of Lawrel, and on the other the Arms of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that, ſhall be carry'd a green Croſs, wrapt about with black Crape; and after it ſhall march ſeveral <hi>Grandees</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons of Quality of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> cover'd with Cloaks, that have black and white Croſſes upon them, embroider'd with Gold-Thred. The March ſhall be brought up by fifty Halberdiers or Guards to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> cloath'd in black and white, and commanded by the Marquis <hi>De Pouar,</hi> Hereditary Protector of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Tolleda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Proceſſion has in this order paſt by the <hi>Pallais,</hi> it ſhall come to the <hi>great Place;</hi> the Standart and the green Croſs ſhall be fixt upon the Altar, and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> only, ſhall remain upon the Theater, and ſpend part of the Night in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms, and as ſoon as day breaks, they ſhall celebrate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Maſſes</hi> upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> and all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt be in their Balconies about ſeven a Clock in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; at eight, the Proceſſion ſhall begin to march, as it did the day before, by the company of Charcoal-men, who ſhall place themſelves on the left hand of the <hi>King</hi>'s Balcony, the right ſhall be for his Guards. Afterwards, ſeveral Men ſhall
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:151523:128"/> bear certain Paſt-board Effigies as big as Life; ſome of them repreſenting thoſe that dy'd in Priſon, whoſe Bones ſhall alſo be carry'd in Coffers with Flames painted round them, and the reſt ſhall repreſent thoſe who have eſcap'd, and who have been condemn'd for Contumacy: Theſe Figures ſhall be placed at one end of the Theater. After that, their Sentance ſhall be read, and they ſhall be executed. But I ſhould tell ye, added he, That the Supream Council of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute than all the others: It is believ'd that the King himſelf has not Power to releaſe thoſe which ſhall be accus'd before it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this <hi>Tribunal</hi> acknowledges the <hi>Pope</hi> only to be above it, and that there has been a time, when upon ſome occaſions the <hi>King</hi>'s Power, was found too weak to contend with that of the <hi>Inquiſition. Don Diego Sarmiento</hi> is <hi>Inquiſitor General;</hi> He is a mighty honeſt and good Man; and is about threeſcore Years of age: The <hi>King</hi> nominates the Preſident of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and his <hi>Holineſs</hi> confirms him; But as for the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> the Preſident propoſes them to the King, and after he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of them, he then puts them in their Places.</p>
               <p>This Tribunal takes Cognizance of every thing concerning the <hi>Faith,</hi> and it is abſolutely inveſted both with the <hi>Pope</hi>'s and and the <hi>King</hi>'s Authority, theres no appealing from its Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the two and twenty Tribunals of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which are in all the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and which depend upon this at <hi>Madrid,</hi> every Month render an Account to it, of their <hi>Finances,</hi> and Revenues, and every Year of their Cauſes and Criminals: But thoſe of the <hi>Indies</hi> and the other diſtant Places, only give an Account at the end of every Year. As to the Places of theſe inferior Tribunals, they are fill'd by the <hi>General Inquiſitors,</hi> with the Approbation of the Counſellors. It would be pretty difficult to be able preciſely to reckon up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Officers, which belong to the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> for in <hi>Spain</hi> alone, there's above two and twenty thouſand <hi>Familiars</hi> of the <hi>Holy Office.</hi> They are call'd by this Name, becauſe they are as 'twere Spies, ſcatter'd up and down every where, which are continually giving true or falſe Informations to the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which thoſe are ſeiz'd and taken up, which they accuſe.</p>
               <p>Whilſt with the greateſt Attention I was liſtening to <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> the Marchioneſs <hi>De Palacios</hi> interrupted us, to let us know that we were come near <hi>Tolleda,</hi> and that certain old Ruines of an ancient Caſtle which we ſaw upon our left hand, were thoſe of an enchanted <hi>Palace.</hi> I ſeem'd to <hi>Don Fernand</hi> to doubt of what ſhe affirm'd, upon which he ſaid, you may
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:151523:128"/> think what you pleaſe; but certain it is, that there's for it a very ancient <hi>Tradition</hi> in this Country; and moreover, they pretend that there is a <hi>Cave</hi> ſhut up, and a Propheſie which threaten'd <hi>Spain</hi> with the greateſt Miſeries, when ever this Cave was open'd: Every body terrify'd with this threat, had no mind to draw upon themſelves the ſad Effects, ſo that this place did for ſeveral Ages remain very cloſe. But <hi>Don-Rodrigue,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> leſs credulous, or more curious, caus'd it to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, upon which there were heard moſt terrible Noiſes; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body thought that the very Elements themſelves were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into confuſion, there was ſo violent a Tempeſt: This did not hinder him from going into it, where by light of ſeveral Elamboys, he ſaw the Figures of divers Men, whoſe Cloaths and Arms were very ſtrange: There was one held a Copper Blade in his hand, and upon it was writ in <hi>Arabick,</hi> that the Time drew near, for the Diſſolation of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the Perſons, whoſe Statues were there, would ere long come. I never was in any place, ſaid I ſmiling, where they rely'd ſo much on fabulous Tales, as they do in <hi>Spain: Say rather,</hi> replied he, <hi>that there never was any Woman ſo incredulous as you; and in telling you this Story, I did not think I ſhould alter your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But as much as one can be aſſur'd of a thing by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Men, this Story is credible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now light enough, very plainly to obſerve all the Charms of the Country. We paſt the <hi>Tagus</hi> over a very great and fine Bridge, of which I had heard, and a little after diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>Tolleda</hi> all ſurrounded with Hills and Rocks, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; There are very neat Houſes built amongſt thoſe Hills, deſign'd for the pleaſure of Solitude: The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Tolleda</hi> has one there, whether he goes often: The City ſtands upon the Rock, the unevenneſs of which in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contributes to make it high and low; the Streets are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ill pav'd and troubleſome, which is the reaſon, that all the People of Quality go there, either in Chairs or Litters: And as we were in a Coach, we took up our Quarters in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> becauſe that is only the part to which one can paſs with a Coach; as ſoon as we were arriv'd, we alight at the Hoſpital of <hi>Foira,</hi> which ſtands in the Suburbs, whoſe Building conſiſts of three Sides, within which is a great ſquare Court, and the Church makes up the fourth ſide, and there we heard <hi>Maſs:</hi> This Hoſpital was built by an Arch-biſhop of <hi>Tolleda,</hi> whoſe Monument and Statue in Marble are in the midſt of the body of the Church: The Walls of the City were rebuilt by the <hi>Moors;</hi> on the Sides ſtands a great many little Towers, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:151523:129"/> ſerv'd to defend it; And it would be aſtrong Place, being almoſt encompaſt with the <hi>Tagus,</hi> and having extream deep Ditches, did not the adjacent Hills command it, from whence it were eaſie to batter it down. It was not eight a Clock when we got thither; and we would ſpend the reſt of the Morning in ſeeing the Church, which as 'tis ſaid, is the fineſt in <hi>Europe:</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it <hi>Holy,</hi> whether 'tis upon the Account of the <hi>Relicks</hi> which are there, or for ſome other reaſon which they did not tell me, I know not: If it was as long and as high as 'tis broad, it would be much better. It is beautify'd with divers Chappels as big as Churches; they all ſhine with Gold and Paintings; the chief of which are thoſe of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Martin, Cardinal Sandoual</hi> and the <hi>Conneſtable De Luna.</hi> In the Quire, I ſaw a <hi>Niche,</hi> or hollow place, from whence 'tis pretended there iſſued out for ſeveral days together, a Spring of Water with which the Soldiers and Citizens quencht their thirſt in the time they maintain'd the Sieges againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> when they were half dead with thirſt; For without digreſſing from my ſubject, I muſt tell you, that in the City there is not ſo much as a Well or a Spring, and that they fetch all their Water from the <hi>Tagus,</hi> which is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troubleſom, that one would wonder how <hi>Tolleda</hi> comes to be ſo full of People as 'tis. Near the entrance into the Church, there's a Marble Pillar, which they Reverence, becauſe the Holy <hi>Virgin</hi> appear'd upon't to St. <hi>Alphonſus.</hi> It is encloas'd with an Iron Gate, and through a little Window they kiſs it, and upon it is writ, <hi>Adoraebimus in loco ubi fleterunt pedes ejus.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every <hi>Canon</hi>'s Seat there is a Marble Pillar, and the Sculpture of the Church is fine and curiouſly wrought. I was amaz'd when I ſaw the <hi>Treaſury.</hi> There muſt be thirty Men to carry the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> upon <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day. It is made of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gilt, and there is exquiſitely wrought upon't ſeveral Spires of Steeples, with abundance of Angels and Cherubins: within this, there's alſo another of Maſſy-gold, and ſuch a vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of precious Stones that their value is ineſtimable; the <hi>Chalacies,</hi> the <hi>Patins</hi> and the <hi>Pyxes</hi> are no leſs beautiful: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, every thing ſhines there, with great Diamonds and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Pearls; the <hi>Sun,</hi> where the Holy Sacrament is kept, the Crowns and Robes of the <hi>Virgin</hi> are the moſt ſplendid things, that I ever ſaw in my days. But indeed this Arch-biſhoprick is ſo very rich, that it is but juſt every thing ſhould be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it. I have told you, dear <hi>Couſin,</hi> that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> inform'd me, that the Biſhoprick of <hi>Tollada</hi> had three hundred and Fifty thouſand Crowns a Year. I muſt now add,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:151523:129"/> that the Revenue of the Church it ſelf, is a Hundred thouſand Crowns. Forty <hi>Canons,</hi> which have every one a thouſand Crowns, the Grand <hi>Arch-deacon,</hi> Forty thouſand, three <hi>Arch-deacons,</hi> the firſt of which has fifteen thouſand, the ſecond twelve thouſand, and the third ten thouſand, and the Dean ten thouſand Crowns a Year.</p>
               <p>There is beſides, an infinite number of Chaplains, Clerks of the Chappel, and other Perſons, to whom daily allowances are given.</p>
               <p>There is the Chaplain <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Chappel <hi>de los Rios,</hi> who enjoys twelve thouſand Crowns a year, and ſix others that are under him, have a thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After we had ſpent a great deal of time in conſidering the fine things with which this Court was fill'd, we reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Inn, where we had left our Coach; and juſt when we were going away, there came to us an Almoner and a Gentleman that belong'd to Cardinal <hi>Porto Carrero,</hi> who ſent them to complement us, and to aſſure us, that by no means we muſt lodge any where elſe than at the <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> Palace. They chiefly addreſs'd themſelves to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Palacios</hi> who was near a kin to him, and who earneſtly deſir'd us to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: We excus'd our ſelves upon our being in ſuch Diſorder, not having ſlept that Night, and being in an undreſs: ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her Son to go to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and to beg him to accept our excuſes. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> return'd in a moment, attended with abundance of Pages, ſome of which brought Umbrellos of Gold and Silver Brocado. He told us that his <hi>Eminence</hi> mightily deſir'd we would go to his Houſe, and that he had ſhew'd ſo much concern at our refuſal, that indeed he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to bring us; and thereupon he commanded them to bring Umbrellos to defend us from the Sun, and that they had water'd the place which we mere to croſs from the Church to the Palace. And immediately we ſpy'd two Mules drawing a little Cart, in which there was a Tub full of Water; and we were told that as oft as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was to come to the Church, it was the Cuſtom to water the way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> Palace is very ancient and large, moſt rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſh'd, and every way ſuitable to the Perſon that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it. We were conducted into a very fine Appartment, where immediately they brought us Chocolate, and afterwards, all ſorts of Fruits, Wine, Water and other Liquors cool'd with Ice. We were ſo ſleepy, that after we had eat a little, we begg'd the Marchionneſs <hi>de Palacios</hi> to ſee the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and to excuſe us to him, if we defer'd giving our ſelves that honour,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:151523:130"/> for that we were not able any longer to live without ſleep. And indeed, the young Marchionneſs <hi>de la Roſe,</hi> my Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and my ſelf, choſe to go to bed, and in the Evening, we dreſt our ſelves to ſee the <hi>Queen-Mother.</hi> The Marchioneſs <hi>de Palacios,</hi> who had always been extreamly devoted to her, went to the <hi>Alcacar,</hi> which is the Name of the Caſtle, and made her a viſit whilſt we ſlept; ſo that ſhe told her, ſhe would give us Audience at eight a Clock in the Evening, and that was the firſt time I was dreſt according to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mode.</p>
               <p>I do not think there's a more troubleſome dreſs; ones Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt be ſo ſqueez'd, that it hurts one; there's no lifting up ones Arm, hardly can you get it into the Sleeve. I had on a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingal of a dreadful bigneſs, (for one muſt wear that in the Queen's Preſence) I know not what to do with my ſelf with this ſtrange Invention; there's no ſitting down in it, and I believe if I ſhould wear it all my Life, I ſhould never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to it. My Head was dreaſt after the <hi>Melene</hi> faſhion, that is, the Hair all ſpread over the Neck, and ty'd at the end with ſome Non-pareil Ribbon, this is a great deal hotter than a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine; ſo that being now in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi> you may eaſily gueſs how I paſs away my time. But this being a ceremonial Dreſs of the Head, there was nothing to be omitted upon ſuch an occaſion; beſides, I wore their <hi>Patins</hi> which are fitter to break ones Neck, than to walk with. When we were all in a Condition to appear, for my Kinſwoman and my Daughter were both alſo dreſt after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, we were led into a Chamber of State, where the Cardinal came to ſee us; his Name is <hi>Don Luis Porto Carrero,</hi> he may be about two and forty years old, he's very civil, is of a ſweet complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Temper, and hath well learnt the polite Breeding of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> He ſtay'd an hour with us, and afterwards there was ſerv'd up to us a very plentiful Meal; but every thing was ſo full of Amber, that I never taſted any Sawces ſo rich, and leſs pleaſant. I fancy'd my ſelf at this Table, like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> in the midſt of Victuals, and yet ſtarv'd with hunger, becauſe I could not eat; for either all the Meat was perfum'd, or elſe full of Saffron, Garlick, Onion, Pepper and Spices: but with ſearching about, I found ſome Jellies and white Meats, which were admirable, and with which I ſav'd my ſelf harmleſs. There were alſo brought to Table a Ham of Bacon, which came from the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and which is better than either thoſe they boaſt ſo much of at <hi>Bayonu,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Ments;</hi> but it was ſpread all over with certain little Comfits, which in <hi>France</hi> we call Non-pariel, the Sugar of which melted in the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:151523:130"/> Fat; it was drawn full of Limon-peel, which abated much of its goodneſs. The Fruit was the beſt and the pleaſanteſt thing one can ſee, for whole Trees with their Fruit were Iced over with Sugar after the <hi>Italian</hi> way; you'll eaſily believe the Trees were not very big. There were Orange Trees thus order'd, with little artificial Birds faſtned in them. There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Cherry Trees, Rasberry and Goſeberry Buſhes, and others ſet in little Caſes of Silver.</p>
               <p>We did not ſit long at Table, becauſe the hour for ſeeing the Queen was near; we were carry'd thither in Chairs, though it is a pretty diſtance, and very much up Hill; for the <hi>Alcacar</hi> is built upon a Rock of a prodigious height, and the Proſpect is admirable. Before the Gate there is a very wide Place, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one comes into a Court an hundred and ſixty foot long, and an hundred and thirty broad, adorn'd with two rows of Piazza's, ten rows of the Pillars which made the length, were all of one entire Stone; and the breadth had eight rows of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and this made a fine ſhow. But that which pleaſes much better, is the Stair-caſe at the bottom of the Court, which is an hundred and thirty foot wide, like the Court. After one has gone up ſome ſteps it parts in two, and to ſpeak the Truth, I believe 'tis one of the faireſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> We went through a great Gallery, and vaſt Appartments, but met in them ſo few People, that it did not look as if one could have met with the Queen-Mother of <hi>Spain</hi> there; ſhe was in a great Hall, whoſe Windows were all open, and which had a Proſpect to the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and the River. The Hangings, Cuſhions, Carpets and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy were all of gray Cloth; the Queen was ſtanding and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Balcony, having in her hand a great pair of Beads. When ſhe ſaw us, ſhe turn'd towards us, and receiv'd us with a Countenance merry enough. We had the Honour to kiſs her Hand, which is little, lean and white: She is very pale, her Complexion pure, her Face a little long and flat, her Looks are agreeable, and her Stature is of a middle ſize; ſhe was dreſt as all the Widdows in <hi>Spain</hi> are, that is, like a <hi>Nun,</hi> without ſo much as one Hair appearing; and there are many, (though ſhe's not of that number) that cauſe all their Hair to be cut off when they loſe their Husbands, for a greater expreſſion of their Grief. I obſerv'd that her Gown was tuck'd up quite round, that ſo it might be let down as it wears out; yet I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe practiſes this, but ſuch is the faſhion of the Country. She ask'd me how long I had been come from <hi>France,</hi> and I gave her an account; ſhe enquir'd if they diſcours'd then of a Marriage between her Son and <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Orleance,</hi> and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:151523:131"/> I told her no; then ſhe ſaid ſhe would ſhow me her Picture which was drawn from that the King her Son had, and ſhe bid one of her Ladies, who was an old Duenna, and very ugly, bring it. It was drawn in water Colours, in the bigneſs of ones hand, in a Box cover'd with black Sattin, and lin'd with green Velvet. Do you find, ſays ſhe, that it is like her? I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd her that there were not any of her Features; for indeed it ſeem'd to ſquint, the Face was awry, and nothing could leſs reſemble a Princeſs ſo perfect as <hi>Madamoiſelle.</hi> She ask'd me whether ſhe was more or elſe handſome than this Picture. I told her, that ſhe was handſomer beyond compariſon. <hi>The King my Son then,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>will be pleaſantly cheated, for he believes this Picture is juſt like her, and no body can be better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied than he is with her. For my part, her Eyes that look askew were troubleſome to me; but to comfort my ſelf, I conſider'd that ſhe had a great ſhare of Wit, and divers other good Qualitles. Do not you remember,</hi> ſays ſhe, to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Palacios, to have ſeen my Picture in the late King's Chamber? Yes, Madam,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>and very well remember alſo, that as ſoon as we ſaw your Majeſty, we all wondred extreamly, why the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would do you ſo much wrong; that's what I would have ſaid to you,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>for when I arriv'd here, and caſt my Eyes upon that Picture which they ſaid was made for me, I in vain try'd to believe it, but I could not do't.</hi> A little ſhe Dwarf, but thick as a Tun, and no taller than a good big Muſhroom, cloth'd all in Gold and Silver Brocade, with long Hair hanging dowh to her Feet, came in, and kneeling before the Queen, ask'd her if ſhe would pleaſe to have Supper; upon which we offer'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, but ſhe told us, we might follow her, and ſhe went into a Parlour all of Marble, ſhe ſat down to Table all alone, and we all ſtood round her. Her Maids of Honour, with the <hi>Camera Mayor,</hi> who look'd very ſad, came to wait on her. I ſaw ſome of them, which methinks were very handſome; they talkt to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Palacios,</hi> and told her, that they were hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly tyr'd with that ſort of Life, and that they liv'd at <hi>Tolleda,</hi> as if they were in a Deſart. Theſe were called <hi>Damas de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecio,</hi> and they wear <hi>Patins;</hi> but for the little <hi>Menines,</hi> they wear Shooes quite flat; the <hi>Menines</hi> are Children of the higheſt Quality, and neither wear Cloak nor Sword.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral Diſhes brought before the Queen, the firſt were Melons cool'd with Ice, and ſome Sallets and Milk, of which ſhe eat plentifully before ſhe touch'd any of the Fleſh, which look'd ill enough. She does not want a Stomach, and ſhe drank a little Wine pure, ſaying that was to digeſt her Fruit:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:151523:131"/> When ſhe call'd for Drink, the firſt <hi>Menin</hi> brought her Cup cover'd upon a Salver, and kneeling gave it to the <hi>Camarera,</hi> who alſo kneel'd when the Queen took it from her Hands; and on the other ſide, a Lady of the Palace preſented upon Knee a Napkin to the Queen to wipe her Mouth with: She gave ſome dry'd Sweet-meats to <hi>Donna Mariguita de Palacios,</hi> and to my Daughter, in ſaying to them, they muſt not eat much of ſuch things, becauſe they ſpoyl'd the Teeth of young Girls. She ask'd me divers times, how the Moſt Chriſtian Queen did, and how ſhe diverted her ſelf? She ſaid, that ſhe had lately ſent her ſome Boxes of Amber Paſtils, ſome Gloves, and ſome Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate: She was above an hour and half at Table, ſpeaking little, but ſeem'd merry enough. We deſired to know her Commands for <hi>Madrid,</hi> whereupon ſhe expreſs'd a great deal of Kindneſs and Civility, and after that we took our leave of her. It cannot be deny'd, that this Queen has abundance of Underſtanding, as well as Courage and Vertue, to take as ſhe does, ſo tedious a Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that the firſt <hi>Menine</hi> brings the Queens Patins and puts them on; this is ſo great an Honour in this Country, that they would not change it for the beſt place belonging to the Crown. When the Ladies of the Palace mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and with the Queens conſent, ſhe adds to their Portions fifty thouſand Crowns, and commonly ſome Government or Vice-Royalty is given to their Husbands.</p>
               <p>When we came back to the Cardinal's Houſe, we found a Theater prepar'd in a mighty great Room, and abundance of Ladies on one ſide, and Cavalleros on the other; and that which ſeem'd pretty odd to me, was a Damask Curtain which was drawn all the length of the Room to the very Theater, and ſo hindred the Men and the Women from ſeeing one another: They only ſtay'd for us, to begin the Comedy of <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe;</hi> this was a new Play, but the worſt that I have yet ſeen in <hi>Spain.</hi> Afterwards the Comedians danced very well, and the Diverſion laſted till after two a Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>There was given a ſtately Supper in a great Hall, where there were divers Tables; and when the Cardinal had placed us, he went back to the Cavalleros, who had the ſame things on their ſide as we had: There was an excellent <hi>Italian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of Muſick, for his Eminence had brought with him Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians from <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom he gave large Penſions. It was ſix a Clock in the Morning before we could retire to our Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as there were divers things for us yet to ſee, inſtead of going to bed; we went to the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> which they call
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:151523:132"/> 
                  <hi>Secodebet;</hi> the Houſes which environ it are of Brick, and all uniform, with Balconies: It is of a round Figure, and has Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azzas about it, under which People walk, and this is a fine Place. We went back to the Caſtle to view it better and more leiſurely; The Building is after the <hi>Gothick</hi> faſhion, and very ancient; but there's ſomething in't that looks ſo great, that I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Charles</hi> V. had rather have liv'd there, than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City under his Obedience. It contains in a ſquare, four great Appartments with their ſeveral Wings and Pavillions; there's room enough conveniently to lodge the whole Court of a great King. We were ſhew'd a Machine that was very ſtrange before it was broken; it was to draw up the Water from the <hi>Tagus,</hi> and to make it riſe to the top of the <hi>Alcacar;</hi> the Houſe where it ſtood is yet whole, though it be ſeveral Ages ſince it was built. There's above five hundred ſteps from it to the River ſide; when the Water was come into the Receiver, it ran by certain Channels into all parts of the City where there were Fountains: This was a mighty Conveniency, for now they are forced to draw their Water thirty fathom deep.</p>
               <p>We went and heard Maſs in the Church <hi>de Los Reys:</hi> It is fair and large, and all full of Oranges and Pomegranet Trees, Jaſſemin and Mirtles, that are very high; they are ſet in Caſes, and are form'd into Walks up to the very high Altar, whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments are extraordinary rich, ſo that looking through all theſe green Boughs, and the Flowers of different Colours, upon the ſhining Gold, Silver, Embroidery, and great lighted Candles which adorn the Altar, it ſeems as if the Rays of the Sun play'd before your Eyes. There are alſo ſome Cages painted and gilt, and fill'd with Nightingales, Canary Birds and others, which make a charming noiſe. I ſhould be very glad that in <hi>France</hi> they would imitate them in adorning our Churches. The Walls of this Church is all over cover'd on the outſide with the Chains and Irons of the Captives which have been redeem'd out of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</hi> In this part of the Town I obſerv'd that moſt of the Houſes had upon their Doors a ſquare piece of Earthen Ware, upon which was ſet the Angelical Salutation in theſe words, <hi>Maria ſue concebida ſin peca lo original.</hi> I was told that theſe Houſes belong'd to the Arch-biſhop, and that none but thoſe that work in Silk dwell in them, of which there are very many at <hi>Tolleda.</hi> The two ſtone Bridges croſs the River are very high, broad and long: If they would but take a little pains with the <hi>Tagus,</hi> Boats might come up to the City, this would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Conveniency; but they are naturally too lazy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Profit and Advantage of a work is to be prefer'd
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:151523:132"/> before the trouble of undertaking it. We alſo ſaw the Hoſpital of <hi>Los Linnos;</hi> that is of Foundlings, and the City-Houſe which is near the Cathedral; and at laſt our Curioſity being ſatisfy'd, we came back to the Archiepiſcopal Palace, and we went to Bed and laid till Night, when again we had another Feaſt as ſplendid as the former: His Eminence eat with us, and when we had return'd him all due thanks, we ſet forward towards the Caſtle of <hi>Ignarica:</hi> The Marquiſs <hi>de Palacios,</hi> with all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, was there waiting for us; ſo that we were ſo obligingly receiv'd, that nothing can be added to the good Chear and to the Pleaſure, with which we were entertain'd for ſix days, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Fiſhing upon the River <hi>Xarama,</hi> of in Hunting, in Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in common Converſation: Every one was Emulous to appear good humour'd; and one may ſay, that when the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> go ſo far as to lay aſide their Gravity, and know and love you, they contribute hugely to eaſe and recreate the Mind. They become ſociable, obliging, earneſt to pleaſe you, and the beſt Company in the World. This is what I have found in this little Journey I have made, of which I ſhould not have given you ſo particular an Account; but yet I am perſwaded, Dear Couſin, you deſire it ſo, and that you ſet ſome value upon my Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</p>

We went up at a grivate Pair of Stairs, where one of the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s Gentlemen waited to receive us, and we tarry'd for ſome time in a very fine Cloſet full of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Books, well bound and very diverting: There amongſt others, I found the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> the famous <hi>Knight of the Manca,</hi> in which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:151523:133"/> the plainneſs and the ſubtilty of the Expreſſion, the weight and ſtrength of Proverbs, and that which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>El pico,</hi> that is the ſmartneſs and nicety of a Language, appear'd quite otherwiſe, then the Tranſlations which we have in <hi>French.</hi> I was ſo pleas'd in reading it, that I hardly thought of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ceremony: It began as ſoon as the Marquis <hi>De Villars</hi> came, and through a Lattice-window which was open'd, we ſaw what paſt. The <hi>King</hi> placed himſelf at the end of the great Gilt-Hall, which is one of the moſt ſtately in the Palace; The <hi>Alcove</hi> was ſpread with a wonderful fine Carpet; the The Throne and the Canopy were embroider'd with Pearls, Diamonds, Rubies, Emeraulds and other precious Stones. Cardinal <hi>Portocarrero</hi> ſat in a great Chair below the <hi>Alcove,</hi> on the right hand of the Throne; the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Stool; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador was ſeated on the left hand of the Throne upon a Bench covered with Velvet, and the <hi>Grandees</hi> were placed near the Cardinal; when every body was ſeated according to their Quality, the <hi>King</hi> came in, and when he was in his Throne, the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> and the <hi>Grandees</hi> ſet down and cover'd themſelves. A Secretary read aloud, the Power which the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King had ſent to his Ambaſſador. After that, a little Table was brought and ſet before the <hi>King,</hi> with a Crucifix and a Book of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,</hi> and whilſt he held his hand upon it, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> read the Oath, by which he ſwore to keep the Peace with <hi>France:</hi> There were ſome other little Ceremonies, but I did not mind them well enough to be able to give you an Account of 'em. A little after the <hi>King</hi> return'd to his Lodgings, but we were gone out of them before: We ſtay'd in the ſame Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet where we ſtopt at firſt: It was ſo near his Chamber, that we heard him ſay, that he was never ſo hot, and that he would put off his Collar: And indeed, the Sun does ſhine very hot in this Country: At my firſt coming hither, I was afflicted with a ſtrange Meagrim, and could not imagine the cauſe of it; but my Kinſwoman told me 'twas becauſe I wore too much upon my Head, and that if I did not take care I might loſe my ſight ſo; I immediately threw off my Bonnets and my Cornets, and ſince that time I have never had any pain in my Head. For my part, I cannot believe that there is in any part of the World more ſerene Air than there's here: It is ſo pure, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive ſo much as one Cloud; and it is affirm'd to me, that even the Weather here in Winter, is like the fineſt Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any other Country: That which is moſt dangerous here is, a certain Wind <hi>De Galiegue,</hi> which blows off the Mountains
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:151523:133"/> of the Mountains <hi>Gallicia:</hi> It is not violent, but 'tis ſo piercing, that it reaches the very Bones, and ſometimes cauſes a Lameneſs in a Leg or an Arm, and often in half the Body, which laſts for ones life: It is more frequent in Summer than in Winter. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers take it for the Weſtern Briezes, and are raviſht when they feel it, but experience convinces them of its Malignity. The Seaſons in <hi>Spain</hi> are much more convenient and pleaſant than either in <hi>France, England, Holland,</hi> or <hi>Germany;</hi> For hot to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon that purity of Air, which cannot be imagin'd ſo fine as 'tis from the Month of <hi>September</hi> to the Month of <hi>June,</hi> it is not ſo cold, but one can make a ſhift without fire; and this is the reaſon, why there's no Chimneys in any of their Appartments, and that they make uſe only of Chafindiſhes. But 'tis a great Happineſs that Wood being ſo ſcarce as 'tis in this Country, they have no occaſion for't; It never freezes thicker than the thickneſs of two Crowns, and there falls little Snow. But the adjacent Mountains furniſh <hi>Madrid</hi> with it all the Year round: The Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> are indeed exceſſive hot.</p>
               <p>I was lately in a Company where all the Ladies were ſadly frighted: One of 'em ſaid, that ſhe had received a Letter from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which advis'd, that a Bell there, which was only rung upon ſome publick Calamity, or upon ſome occaſion of the higheſt Conſequence, had all alone rung ſeveral times: This Lady came from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and ſhe aſſur'd me, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Misfortune and Miſery is to befal <hi>Spain,</hi> or that any of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is to die, this Bell rings; that for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour together the Clapper of the Bell moves with a ſtrange quickneſs, and ſtrikes in turning round: I would not believe it, neither do I yet: But all the Company confirm'd what ſhe ſaid: If it is a Lye, there were above twenty that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with her in it. They began to think upon what, and on whom this unhappineſs which by this ſign is foretold was to fall; and as they are very Superſtitious, the beautiful Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>De Liche,</hi> encreaſt their fears, by telling them, that <hi>Don John</hi> was very ſick.</p>
               <p>In their deep Mourning, they are attir'd like Fools, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the firſt days; for the Foot-men as well as the Maſters have long Cloaks trailing, and inſtead of Hats, they wear a very high Paſt-board Cap cover'd with Crape; their Horſes are all in black Trappings, and Houſſings which cover their Heads and all their Bodies: Nothing looks uglier; their Coaches are ſo ill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, that the Cloth which covers the Roof, hangs almoſt down to the Boots: No body that ſees this doleful Equipage but would think, that ſome Corps is a carrying to be bury'd; the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:151523:134"/> People of Quality wear their Cloaks of black Bays, very thin and rotten, the leaſt thing tears it in pieces: And that Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is moſt graceful, that is moſt ragged and tatter'd. I have ſeen ſome <hi>Cavelleros</hi> which tore their Cloaths on purpoſe; and I aſſure you, that through ſome of their Cloaths, you may ſee their Skin as ugly as 'tis to look on: For though their Children when they are young, are as white as Alablaſter, and ſo pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that you wou'd take them for Angels, yet it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as they grow bigger, they alter very ſtrangely; the heat of the Sun roaſts them, the Air tans them, and 'tis eaſy to know a <hi>Spaniard</hi> from any other Nation: Their Features are nevertheleſs regular, but ſtill there wants methinks our Air and Meen as well as our Skin and Complexion.</p>
               <p>All the Scholars wear long Robes, with a little Border of Linnen about their Necks inſtead of a Collar; they are habitted very like the Jeſuits; there's of 'em above thirty Years old; they are known to be Students yet by their Habits.</p>
               <p>I fancy this City to look like a great Coup, in which they feed Poultry: For really, from the Level of the Street to the fourth Story, one can ſee nothing but Lattices whoſe holes are very ſmall; and their very Balconies have 'em: There's always to be ſeen ſome of the poor confin'd Women ſtanding behind them, to look upon Paſſengers, and when they dare, they open them, and with great delight ſhew themſelves; there's not a Night paſſes without four or five hundred Conſorts of Muſick, in ſeveral parts of the Town; it's true they are at a moderate rate, and it is ſufficient if a Gallant has only his Guittar or his Harp, and ſometimes both joyn'd with a Voice hoarſe enough to awake the moſt drowſy body, and afford 'em the pleaſure of a Queen: If either they do not underſtand what is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or cannot obtain it, they are content with what they can get: I never ſaw any Virginals or Theorba's here.</p>
               <p>In every Street, and at every corner Houſe, there's an Image or Statue of our Lady dreſs'd after the Faſhion of the Country; with a Pair of Beads in her Hands, and either a great Wax Candle or a Lamp burning before her: I have ſeen three or four in my Kinſwoman's Stable, with other pieces of Devotion; for you muſt know, that every Groom will have his Oratory as well as his Maſter, though perhaps neither one nor t'other often pray there. When one Lady goes to viſit another, if it be in the Night, four Pages comes to receive her with great Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys of white Wax, and in the ſame manner conduct her out again, and while ſhe's going into her Chair, they commonly kneel upon one Knee: This is ſomething more ſplendid, than
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:151523:134"/> the ſmall Wax Candles enclos'd in Links which are us'd in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are Houſes on purpoſe for Women of lewd Lives, like the <hi>Madelonnettes</hi> at <hi>Paris:</hi> They uſe them very ſeverely, and there is not a day paſſes that they are not whipt ſeveral times; in a certain time they are releas'd, but come out worſe than they went in, what they ſuffer'd making them not a bit the better. They live almoſt altogether in a particular part of the Town, where vertuous Women never go, but if by chance any one does go that way, they run and purſue after her, as if ſhe was their Enemy; and if it happens that they are the ſtrongeſt, ſhe is ſure to be cruelly us'd; and for the <hi>Cavalleros,</hi> they run the Riſque of being torn in pieces as oft as they paſs that way; that is to ſay, who ſhall have 'em: One takes him by the Arm, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Legs, and a third by the Head, and if he grows angry, they altogether fall upon him and rob him, and even ſtrip him of his Cloaths. My Kinſwoman has a Page who was ignorant of the Tricks of theſe wretched Wenches, and went innocently through their Quarters, but they ſtript him as naked as common Thieves in a Wood could have done; and yet a Man muſt be content with this Treatment, For to whom ſhall he go for Reſtitution?</p>
               <p>The Bell of <hi>Barcelona</hi> hath been but too true in its Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, for <hi>Don John</hi> was the firſt of this Month brought down ſo very low with his ſickneſs, that the Phyſicians deſpair'd of him, and he was advis'd to prepare himſelf for Death: He receiv'd the News with ſo much Tranquility and Reſignation, as very much confirm'd the Belief that ſeveral Perſons had before entertain'd, that he had taken ſome private diſguſt, which made him rather wiſh to die than live: The King came every moment into his Chamber, and ſpent ſeveral hours at his Bed-ſide, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his earneſt Prayers that he would not ſo expoſe himſelf to a Feaver: He receiv'd the Bleſſed <hi>Viaticum,</hi> made his Will, and writ a Letter to a Lady whoſe name I could not learn: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Don Antonio Ortis</hi> his chief Secretary to carry it with a little Box lockt, which I ſaw; it was made of <hi>China</hi> Wood, and light enough to make one think there was in't nothing but Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and perhaps ſome Jewels; while he was ſo dangerouſly ſick a Courrier arriv'd with the News of the King's Marriage with <hi>Mademoiſelle;</hi> the Joy of which did not only fill the Palace, but all the City ſhew'd Expreſſions of it, for there were over the whole Town Artificial Fire-works and Illuminations for three Days together: The King could not contain himſelf, but run into <hi>Don John</hi>'s Chamber, and although he was very drowſy and heavy to ſleep, and wanted reſt, yet he awak'd him to tell him
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:151523:135"/> that the Queen would quickly be here, and intreated him to think of nothing but being well again, that he might aſſiſt at her reception. Ah! <hi>Syre,</hi> anſwered the Prince to him, <hi>I ſhall never have that Satisfaction, I ſhould be content to die, if I had had the Honour to have ſeen her once:</hi> The King fell a weeping, and told him, <hi>That ſeeing him in that Condition, was the only thing that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd his Happineſs.</hi> There was to have been a Bull-Feaſt, but the Prince's ſickneſs has caus'd it to be put off, and the King would not have ſuffer'd any Fire-works in the Palace-Court, had not <hi>Don John,</hi> notwithſtanding he had a violent pain in his Head, begg'd him to permit them. In fine, the 17th of this Month he dy'd extreamly regretted by ſome, and as little by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This is the fate both of Princes and Favourites, as well as of Perſons that move in an ordinary Sphere; and as his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit was already declining, and the Courtiers now thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Queen-Mother's Return, and the Arrival of the new Queen, ſo it is a mighty ſtrange thing to obſerve with what indifference the Sickneſs and Death of <hi>Don John</hi> was taken; they did not ſo much as talk on him the very next day; It ſeem'd as if he had never been in the World. Alas! Dear Couſin, does not this deſerve a little to be reflected on? He govern'd all the Kingdoms of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his very name ſtruck Terror, he caus'd the Queen-Mother to be baniſht; he drove away Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> and <hi>Valenuela,</hi> who were both Favourites, he had for the moſt part a greater Court than the King: And yet four and twenty hours after he was dead, I believe I ſaw in different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fifty Perſons of the higheſt Quality, which did not ſo much as ſpeak one word of this poor Prince, notwithſtanding divers of them had very great Obligations to him: And yet after all, he had very great perſonal Qualifications and Vertues: He was of a middle Stature, and a well ſhap'd body, his Features were regular, his Eyes black and lively, he had black Hair, a great deal of it, and very long: He was well bred, of a great Wit and Judgment, very generous, brave and beneficent, and had a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for the higheſt Affairs. He was not ignorant of any thing that was ſuitable to his Birth, nor of any of the Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. He both ſpoke and writ very well five ſeveral Languages, and underſtood more: He was perfectly well read in Hiſtory; he could both make and play upon any Inſtrument as well as the beſt Maſter. He underſtood how to turn ſeveral things; he could forge Arms, and he delighted much in the Mathematicks; but being call'd to the management of the Government, he was oblig'd to take his Thoughts off all theſe Exerciſes. The face of things chang'd in a moment, his Eyes were ſcarce clos'd,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:151523:135"/> before the King (mov'd only by his own kind and eaſie Nature for the Queen his Mother) run to <hi>Tolleda</hi> to ſee her, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her to return; ſhe conſented to it with all the Joy ſhe had to ſee the King. They wept not a little, while they embrac'd each other, and we ſaw 'em come back together. All the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality went to meet their Majeſties, and the People ſhew'd abundance of Joy. I ſhould inlarge a great deal more upon this return, did I not intend to be very particular in the Memoirs I am writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don John</hi> laid three days in his Bed of State, and in the ſame Cloaths which he had made to go meet the young Queen; after that he was carried to the <hi>Eſcurial:</hi> The Funeral had nothing of Greatneſs; the Officers of his Houſe, with a very few Friends accompany'd him: He was laid in the little Vault near the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon,</hi> which is reſerved ſolely for the Princes and Princeſſes of the Royal Blood; for there are none bury'd in the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> you muſt know, but Kings, and thoſe Queens that have had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; thoſe that have had none, are bury'd in that particular Vault. In a few days we are to go to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> which will be when the King goes there; but he is ſo taken up with his young Queen, that he can think of nothing but going towards the Frontiers to meet her. In every place where I come, they are continually ringing it aloud in my Ears, that ſhe'll quickly be Queen of two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d twenty Kingdoms. In all likelyhood there's eleven of them in the <hi>Indies;</hi> for I only know thoſe of the old and new <hi>Caſtille, Arragon, Valentia, Navarre, Murcia, Grenada, Andalouſia, Gallicia, Leon,</hi> and the Iſles <hi>Majorques.</hi> In theſe Places there are ſome parts of them admirable, upon which it ſeems as if Heaven had a mind to ſpread abroad its moſt benign Influences. There are others again ſo barren, that there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corn, Herbs, Vines, Fruit, Meadows, nor Springs; and of theſe one may ſay, there's more than of the others. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, the Air there is good and wholſome. In certain parts the Heats are exceſſive, and in others the Cold and the Winds are inſupportable, although 'tis in the ſame Seaſon. There are a great many Rivers, but that which is pretty ſingular, is, that the biggeſt of them is not Navigable; particularly thoſe of <hi>Tagus, Guadiana, Minchio, Duero, Guadalguiver,</hi> and that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre;</hi> for either becauſe of the Rocks, the falls of Water, the Gulphes, or the Turnings, Veſſels cannot paſs upon them, and this is one of the greateſt Difficulties of Trade, and which moſt of all hinders thoſe things from coming to Cities which there's need of; for if there was an eaſie Communication between them, thoſe Places and Towns that want a great many Wares
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:151523:136"/> and Goods, might be ſupplyed from thoſe that abound, and ſo every body might be furniſh'd with neceſſary things at a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable price; whereas the Charges by Land-carriage being ſo high, one muſt want divers Conveniences, unleſs you are in a Condition to pay three times more for a thing than 'tis worth.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the ſeveral Cities which belong to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> theſe are eſteem'd, either for Beauty or Riches, <hi>viz. Madrid, Seville, Grenada, Valentia, Sarragouſa, Tolleda, Vailladolid, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua, Salamancha, Cadiz, Naples, Milan, Meſſina, Palermo, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliari, Bruxelles, Antwerp, Gand,</hi> and <hi>Mons.</hi> There are a great many others which nevertheleſs are very conſiderable; and ſeveral of the Towns are as big as Cities; but there are not in them thoſe multitudes of People, which are both the Riches and Strength of a King. And there are divers Reaſons to be given why there is this defect. <hi>Firſt,</hi> When King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the Inquiſition, what through the Puniſhments they inflicted upon ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> and the baniſhing of others, there dy'd and went out of the Kingdom in a little while, above nine hundred thouſand Perſons; beſides, the <hi>Indies</hi> draw away abundance; the Unfortunate go there to enrich themſelves, and when they have done ſo, they remain to enjoy the fruit of their Labour, and the Pleaſures of the Country. Again, Soldiers are rais'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſent away to Gariſon other Cities under the obedience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the King; theſe Soldiers marry and ſettle in the Places where they happen to be, and never return to thoſe from whence they came. Add to this, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman bear but few Children; if they have three 'tis reckon'd abundance: and Strangers do not come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit there, as in other parts of the World, becauſe they are not lov'd there, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are naturally <hi>recatados,</hi> that is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and reſerv'd to themſelves, and will not be communicative and open with other Nations, which they either envy or ſcorn: And thus having examin'd into all thoſe means which help to depopulate the Country under his Catholick Majeſty, one may rather wonder that there are ſo many People remaining.</p>
               <p>There grows but little Corn in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> it is brought from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily, France</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and indeed, how ſhould it grow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Earth would produce it of it ſelf, as the Land of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> did? The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are too idle to take pains to Till and improve it; for being the meaneſt Peaſant is perſuaded that he is <hi>Hidalgo,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that in every little Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there's an Apocryphal Hiſtory, compos'd within an hundred Years, which he leaves to the Children and Nephews of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage as an Inheritance, in which fabulous Hiſtory they are all
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:151523:136"/> made to deſcend from ancient <hi>Chivalry,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors have done wonderful things; reciting that their Great Grandfathers, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Don John,</hi> performed ſuch and ſuch Services to the Crown. I ſay, they having taking up theſe vain Conceits of themſelves, no wonder if they will neither derogate from the <hi>Gravidad,</hi> nor <hi>Decendentia.</hi> At this rate do they talk, and they will more willingly endure Hunger, and all Severities of Life, than work (ſay they) like Mercinaries, which belongs only to Slaves. And thus Pride ſeconded by Sloth, hinder the moſt part of them to ſow their Land, unleſs ſome Strangers come and help them to till their Ground, which by a ſpecial directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and guidance of Providence always happens; Strangers that are more labourious and worldly minded, being mov'd thither by the gain they find; ſo that you ſhall have a ſorry Peaſant ſitting in his Chair reading of a mouldy <hi>Romance,</hi> whilſt theſe Strangers are working for him, in order to carry away his Money.</p>
               <p>There's no Oats to be ſeen, Hay is ſcarce, their Horſes and Mules eat Barley in the Straw chopt ſmall. The Hills and Mountains in theſe Kingdoms I ſpeak of, are of ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious height and length, that I do not believe there's the like in any other part of the World; one meets with ſome of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues in length, which joyn one to another in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd Chain, and which without Hyperbole, are higher than the Clouds, they are called <hi>Sierras,</hi> amongſt which are reckon'd the Mountains of <hi>Pyrenea, Granada, Aſtura, Alcantara, Morena, Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leda, Doua, Molina</hi> and <hi>Albanera.</hi> Theſe Hills render the way ſo very difficult, that no Waggons can paſs, which obliges them to carry all upon Mules, who are ſo ſure footed, that in two hundred Leagues continual travelling amongſt Rocks, and great Flint Stones, they will not ſo much as once ſtumble.</p>
               <p>I have been ſhew'd ſome of the <hi>Patents</hi> the <hi>King</hi> Grants, I never read ſo many Titles, I'll ſet 'em down here. He calls himſelf King of <hi>Spain, Caſtelle, Leon, Navarre, Arragon, Grenada, Tolleda, Valentia, Gallicia, Sevile, Murcia, Jaen, Hieruſalem, Naples, Sicily, Majorque, Minorque</hi> and <hi>Sardignia,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the <hi>Iſles</hi> and <hi>Terra Forma</hi> of the great <hi>Ocean,</hi> Arch Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundia, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, Luxemburgh, Guelderland, Milan,</hi> Count of <hi>Hasburgh, Flanders, Tirol</hi> and <hi>Barcelona,</hi> Lord of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Molina,</hi> Marqueſs of the <hi>Holy Empire,</hi> Lord of <hi>Friezland, Salines, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht, Malines, Overiſſel</hi> and <hi>Groningen;</hi> and Grand Seignior of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> I have been told, that <hi>Francis</hi> I. laught at theſe, when he recriv'd a Letter from <hi>Charles</hi> V. ſtuft with
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:151523:137"/> ſuch arrogant Titles, and in his Anſwer gave himſelf no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Title than <hi>Citizen</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Gentilis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do not trouble their Heads to ſtudy much here, that little they do know bears them out, for with the help of their Wit and Grave looks, they ſeldom betray their ignorance by being at a loſs about any matters; when they ſpeak, they always ſeem to know more than they do; and when they are ſilent, you would think 'em wiſe enough to reſolve the moſt knotty Queſtions. Nevertheleſs there are ſome famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities in <hi>Spain,</hi> amongſt which they reckon, <hi>Saragoſſa, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona, Salamanca, Alcala, Santiago, Grenada, Seville, Coim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, Terragona, Evora, Lisbon, Madrid, Murcia, Majorque, Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leda, Lerida, Valantia</hi> and <hi>Occa:</hi> There are but few famous Preachers; here and there you'll meet with ſome that are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical: But indeed, let theſe Sermons be good or bad, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that hear 'em will perpetually beat their breaſts with an Extraordinary fervour, and even diſturb the Preacher with the grievous Cry which their troubl'd Conſciences make them utter. I am willing to believe that there are a few that have ſome compunction, but in my Conſcience, I doubt far leſs than they make ſhew of: They never leave off their <hi>Swords,</hi> either when they go to Confeſſion or the Sacrament; they ſay, they wear 'em to defend <hi>Religion;</hi> and in the Morning before they put them on, they kiſs 'em and make the ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> with them; they pay an exceſſive Devotion to the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and put an extraordinary confidence in her; there's hardly any Man that does not wear a <hi>Scapular</hi> or ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd <hi>Image</hi> that hath toucht ſome of thoſe that are held to be <hi>miraculous;</hi> and thô otherwiſe they do not lead lives very regular, yet they will not forbear praying to <hi>her</hi> with a truſt, that 'tis <hi>ſhe</hi> that muſt protect and ſave 'em from the greateſt Evils; they are very charitable, not only upon the account of the Merits by Alms Deeds, but alſo by a natural Inclination they have to give, and a real pain they endure if either through Poverty, or for any other reaſon they are forc'd to refuſe any thing that is askt them; they have alſo another good Quality, which is never to forſake their Friend in Sickneſs; their care and their concern is far greater in ſuch a time, when doubtleſs the Preſence as well as the Aſſiſtance of a Friend is moſt want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So that Perſons that do not ſee one another four times in a Year, yet are conſtant in their viſit three or four time every day; when one is under any affliction, and that they can become uſeful to each other: But as ſoon as they are well, they reſume the ſame way of living they us'd before they were ſick.</p>

                  <hi>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</hi> of whom I now talk to ye, Dear Couſin, as if he and you were well acquainted, is return'd; He hath brought me a Letter from the fair Marchioneſs <hi>De los Rios,</hi> who without doubt, is ſtill one of the prettieſt Women in the World, and who is not weary of her retirement, I alſo by him heard from the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Burgos,</hi> whoſe Merits are uncommon; and he added, that he came back in the company of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman, who had told him ſome very wonder-things; amongſt others, that every <hi>Spaniard</hi> who is born on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> whenever they go by or through any Church-yard, in which there has been any body burry'd that was murder'd, or if they paſs through any place where a Murder has been committed, tlthô the Man who was kill'd has been taken away, yet for all that he appears to 'em all bloody, and in the ſame manner and condition he happen'd to be in when he was murder'd, and this too, whether they knew one another or no: This certainly is a very unpleaſant thing to thoſe it happens; but in requital they can cure the Plague with breathing upon the Party, and do not receive the Infection, althô they be with thoſe that have the Plague upon them: Many People, ſaid he, wondred that <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. held his head ſo high, and ſtair'd up with his eyes, the reaſon was, he was born on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> and when he was very young he had ſeveral Apperitions of of theſe Perſons that had been murder'd; ſo that with the fright of 'em he had got a cuſtom (very ſeldom) to hold down his head: But, ſaid I to <hi>Don Frederick,</hi> Did he talk ſeriouſly, and as if theſe things were allow'd of every body without any doubt. And juſt at I was ſaying, that it would be worth while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of ſome creditable Perſon about theſe Matters; <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand de Tolleda</hi> came into my Chamber, and ſo he askt him, and he aſſur'd me, that he had frequently heard folks talk thus of theſe Matters, but yet he would not anſwer for the Truth. It is alſo ſaid, continu'd he, that there are a certain People which can kill a mad Dod with breathing upon him, and that they have a Power to remain in the Fire without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt; and yet I could never ſee any of 'em that car'd to truſt themſelves there: But they give this reaſon, that thô they could ſafely do it, yet there would be ſomething of Vanity in it, by ſuch peculiar Favours from Heaven to diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from other Men; and for my part, ſaid I laughing, I am of Opinion theſe Men have more Prudence than Humility: They are afraid (as 'tis but reaſonable) of the biting of the Dog, and the heat of the Furnace. I am altogher of, your mind, <hi>Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Frederick,</hi> I can give little Faith to things above nature.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:151523:138"/>
               <p>I do not pretend to make you believe it, ſays <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> thô I muſt tell ye, I do not find any thing in this Matter more extraordinary than in a thouſand Prodigies which we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſee. Do ye think, for inſtance, that you ought leſs to wonder at that <hi>Lake</hi> which is near <hi>Guadalajara</hi> in <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſia,</hi> which foretells approaching Tempeſt, by moſt horrid bellowing and roaring, that is heard above twenty thouſand Paces diſtance? and what do ye ſay of that other <hi>Lake</hi> which is found upon the very top of the Mountain <hi>Clavio,</hi> in the <hi>Comte</hi> of <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> near to <hi>Perpignan?</hi> It is extream deep; there's in't Fiſhes, both for bigneſs and ſhape that are monſtrous; when a Stone is thrown into it, there are Vapours ſeen to come out with a mighty noiſe, and to aſcend into the Air, and there convert into the Clouds, which produce moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Storms, accompany'd with Thunder, Lightning and Hail. Is it not likewiſe true, continu'd he, in addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Don Frederick,</hi> that near the Caſtle of <hi>Gracimanos,</hi> in a Cavern which is call'd <hi>Judea,</hi> not far from the Bridge <hi>Talayredas,</hi> there's a Spring whoſe Water freezes as it drops, and grows ſo hard, that it becomes a perfect Stone, which cannot eaſily be broken, and with which in that Country they build fine Houſes? You have a good Stock of Examples, ſaid <hi>Don Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> but if you will, I'll furniſh ye with ſome others for your purpoſe. Do ye remember the Mountain of <hi>Monrayo</hi> in <hi>Arragon;</hi> If the ſheep feed upon't before the ſun riſe they die, but if they are ſick, and feed there after the Sun is up they are cur'd. I muſt not forget neither the Spring in the Iſle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz,</hi> which is dry when 'tis high Water, and runs when the Tide ebbs: You ſhall not be the only Perſon, ſaid I, in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, that ſhall ſecond <hi>Don Fernand</hi> in theſe ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, I muſt tell him, that in the ſame <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> there's a certain Plant which withers upon the firſt appearance of the Sun, and grows green again as ſoon as Night comes. <hi>Ah! pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Plant,</hi> cries <hi>Don Fernand</hi> in Laughing, <hi>Well, I have enough now to be reveng'd for all the ſport you have made at my Stories for this Hour together; I declare open War againſt you about this Plant, and if you do not ſend for one hither, I know what I'll believe:</hi> The facetious Humour of this <hi>Cavallero</hi> made us very pleaſantly paſs the Evening: but we were interrupted by my Kinſwoman, who return'd out of the City, where ſhe had ſpent ſome part of the day at her Lawyers, who was at the point of Death; he is very old, and a very knowing Man in his Profeſſion: She told us, that all his Children ſtood round his Bed, and that the only thing which he recommended to 'em, was always to preſerve a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:151523:138"/> good ſtock of <hi>Gravity;</hi> and after he had bleſt them, ſays he to 'em, what greater good can I now wiſh you, my dear Chidren, than to lead your whole Lives at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and never to quit this <hi>Earthly Paradice,</hi> but for the <hi>Heavenly:</hi> This may ſhew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe, the ſtrange Prepoſſeſſion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have for <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Happineſs they enjoy in that Court: For my part, ſaid I, in interrupting her, I am perſwaded there's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Vanity in that fondneſs that they expreſs for their own Nation, for certainly they have too much Senſe not to know, that there are many other Countries far more agreeable: It is not true, ſaid I, in addreſſing my ſelf to <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> that thô you will not ſay as I ſay, that you have the ſame thoughts? what my thoughts are, ſaid he in ſmiling, is no rule for other folks; I muſt tell ye, that ſince my return, I am upbraided by every body with being no longer a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> But certain it is, that People being ſo bewitcht with the Delights and Charms of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and not having power to forſake it in any ſeaſon of the Year, no body has thought of building pretty Houſes in the Country whither they might ſometimes retire; ſo that all adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts about the City, which ſhould be fill'd with delicious Gardens and ſplendid Seats look like ſo many little Deſerts, and this is the reaſon alſo, why the City in Summer as well as in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is equally crowded with People: Hereupon my Kinſwoman ſaid, ſhe would have me to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> and that it was agreed on by the Marchioneſſes of <hi>Palacios</hi> and <hi>La Roſa,</hi> to go two days hence; the Lady your Mother, added ſhe, in ſpeaking to <hi>Don Fernand</hi> deſigns you to make one, and I indeed to ſecure <hi>Don Frederick,</hi> for another, they both declar'd, that with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Joy, they would go this little Journey; and indeed, the next day we went to kiſs <hi>Queen Mothers</hi> hand, and to know her commands for the <hi>Eſcurial:</hi> for you muſt know, 'tis the Cuſtom, when one is to go out of <hi>Madrid,</hi> firſt to pay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the <hi>Queen.</hi> But we had not ſeen her ſince her Return. ſhe lookt merrier than ſhe did at <hi>Tolleda,</hi> and told us, ſhe did not think of coming back ſo ſoon to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that now it ſeem'd, as if ſhe had never been out of it. There was brought before her a <hi>Gyant-Woman</hi> that came from the <hi>Indies:</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw her, ſhe caus'd her to be taken away, ſhe was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at her. Her Ladies would make this <hi>Coloſſus</hi> dance, who held in each hand two <hi>She Dwarfs</hi> that play'd upon the Caſtinets and the <hi>Biſcay</hi> Drum, all this was ugly in the higheſt degree. My Kinſwoman obſerv'd in the <hi>Queen Mothers</hi> Apartment; things which had been <hi>Don John's</hi> amongſt others an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pendulum Clock, all ſet with Diamonds, he made her in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:151523:139"/> part, his Heir, in all likelyhood 'twas to teſtifie his regret for having troubled and vex'd her.</p>
               <p>The Journey to the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> was perform'd with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Satisfaction, the deſire of entertaining you with it, hindred me from ſending you the Letter I begun before I went thither; the ſame Ladies that went to <hi>Arranjus</hi> and <hi>Tolleda,</hi> were very glad to embrace the Occaſion of taking the Air a little in ſo fine a Seaſon; and we went firſt to the <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is a Royal Houſe, the Building like the reſt in <hi>Spain</hi> is handſom enough, that is, it conſiſts of a ſquare of foul ſeveral Appartments ſeparated by Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of Communication, which are ſupported with Pillars; the Forniture of it, is not indeed ſtately, but there are good Pictures, amongſt others, thoſe of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> in odd ſorts of Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>We were ſhew'd a little Cloſet, which the late King us'd to call his Beloved, becauſe in it he was wont ſometimes to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf with his Miſtreſſes; this Prince who was ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo cold and grave, that he was hardly ever ſeen to laugh, was really the moſt amorous and the pleaſanteſt of Men. There is a Garden well enough kept, and a Park of a conſiderable extent, whither the King frequently goes to hunt; we were afterwards at a Convent of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> which ſtands on the top of a Hill; this is a Place of great Devotion, becauſe of a Crucifix which it ſeems was taken from the true Croſs, and which often works Miracles: After we had ſaid our Prayers there, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on the other ſide of the Hill, to a certain Hermitage where there was a Recluſe, that would neither ſee us, nor ſpeak to us; but he threw a Ticket to us through his Grate, in which we found it writ, that he would recommend us to God. We were all extream weary, for we were forced to walk afoot up the Hill, and it was very hot Weather; we perceiv'd in the bottom of the Hill a very little Cottage by the ſide of a Brook, which runs amongſt Willow Trees; we ſteer'd our Courſe that way, and when we were yet a great way off, we could ſee a Man and a Woman very well dreſt, riſe up nimbly from the foot of a Tree where they were ſett, and run into that Cottage and ſhut the Door as haſtily as if they had taken us for thieves; but doubtleſs it was fear of being known, which made them avoid us; we went to the Place they had left; being ſett on the Graſs, we fell to eating ſome Fruit we brought with us; we were ſo nigh this little Houſe, that they could eaſily ſee through their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows what we were doing; there came out a very pretty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Laſs, and with a Sea-Ruſh Basket addreſt her ſelf to us, and kneeling, begg'd ſome of the Fruit of our Collation for a Big-belly'd
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:151523:139"/> Woman, that would die if we refuſed her. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſent her ſome of the faireſt, and quickly after the ſame young Girl came again with a Gold Snuff-box, and told us the <hi>Senora</hi> of the <hi>Caſita,</hi> that is the Lady of the little Houſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated us to accept of ſome Snuff for an Acknowledgment of the Favour we had done her. It is the Faſhion here to preſent Snuff when they have a mind to expreſs their Friendſhip; we ſtay'd ſo long by the Water-ſide, that we reſolved to go no further that the <hi>Carcuela,</hi> which is another of the King's Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but not ſo handſom as the <hi>Pardo,</hi> and ſo neglected, that there's nothing worth commending, but the Waters; we were ill enough lodg'd there, though we laid in the very ſame Beds his Majeſty did; and we were very lucky in taking along with us all Neceſſaries for Supper. After that we went into the Gardens, which are in bad Order, the Fountains run Day and Night, the Water there is ſo good and in ſuch plenty, that for as little almoſt as one would deſire, it might be made as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a Dwelling as any is in the World. But 'tis not the Cuſtom in this Country, from the King to private Perſons, to keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Country Houſes in good Repair, they let them go to ruin, for want of ſome very ſmall Reparations. Our Beds were ſo ill, that we were not loath to leave them early the next Morning to go to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> We went by <hi>Monareco,</hi> where the Woods begin, and a little further is the Park which belongs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Eſcurial:</hi> For in effect it is one which <hi>Philip</hi> the II. built among the Mountains, that ſo he might the more eaſily get the Stone which he needed, of which there is ſuch a prodigious Quantity, that without ſeeing it, one cannot conceive it, and certainly it is one of the vaſteſt Buildings we have in <hi>Europe:</hi> We went up to it through a very long Walk of Elm Trees, which are planted in four Rows, the great Gate is ſtately adorn'd with divers Marble Pillars rais'd one upon another, till they reach up to the Statue of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> which ſtands on the top; the King's Arms are cut upon a certain Stone which is call'd the Thunder-Stone, and is brought from <hi>Arabia,</hi> the cutting of which coſt threeſcore thouſand Crowns. It is eaſie to believe, that having been at ſo conſiderable a Charge for a thing ſo little uſeful, they would not ſpare any Coſt for others which might be neceſſary and contribute to the Beauty of the Place. It is a great Square Pile of Building; but beyond the Square there runs out a Length, which contains the Buildings of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and are contriv'd to repreſent the Form of the <hi>Gridiron</hi> on which St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> (who is the Patron of the Monaſtry) ſuffer'd Martyrdom. It is built according to the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:151523:140"/> and very plain; the Square is divided in the middle, and one of thoſe Diviſions which looks upon the Order, opens it ſelf both ways into four other leſſer Squares, which are four Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters built alſo according to the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, and who ſees one of them, ſees all the reſt; the Building has nothing in it, either as to its Deſign or Architecture, that is extraordinary; that which is to be admir'd, is the Vaſtneſs of it, being Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty Paces in the Square; for beſides thoſe four Cloyſters I have mentioned, the other Diviſion of the Square, ſubdivided into two, makes two other Piles of Building, one of which is, the King's Quarters, and the other is the Colledge; for there are in it abundance of Penſioners, whom the King maintains to ſtudy: The Friars that live in it are <hi>Hieronomites;</hi> this Order is unknown in <hi>France,</hi> and it is aboliſht in <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe a certain <hi>Hieronimite</hi> Fryar attempted at <hi>Milan</hi> the Life of St. <hi>Charles Borromeo:</hi> But he did not hurt him, though he ſhot at him, and the Bullets pierced his Pontifical Habit; but nevertheleſs this Order is here in great Eſteem; there are three hundred Monks in the Convent of the <hi>Eſcurial;</hi> they live much after the ſame way of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> they ſpeak little, and pray much, and Women never come into their Church, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they ought to ſtudy and preach.</p>
               <p>But there's another thing yet, which makes this Building con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and that is, the nature of the Stone of which it is built. It was taken out of the neighbouring Quarries; it is of a grayiſh colour; the ſharpeſt Air and ſevereſt Weather makes no impreſſion on't, it does not ſoil or grow dirty, but conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerves that colour it had when it was taken up. <hi>Philip</hi> II. was two and twenty years in building it, he enjoyed it thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and then dy'd in't. This Structure coſt him ſix Millions of Gold. <hi>Philip</hi> IV. added the <hi>Pantheon</hi> to it, that is to ſay a <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> like the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> contriv'd under the great Altar of the Church, all of Marble, Jaſper and Porphiry, in which there are ſix and twenty moſt ſtately Tombs inchaſed in the Walls; and one goes down into it by a pair of Stairs all of Jaſper. I fancy'd my ſelf deſcending into ſome of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted places which our Romances and Books of Chevalry talk of. The Tabernacle, the Architecture of the Altar, the ſteps by which one aſcends to it, the Pyx or Box in which the Hoſt is kept, and made all of one ſingle Agat, are ſo many Wonders. The Riches that are there, in precious Stones and Gold, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. One ſingle Cupboard of Relicks (for there are four in the four Chappels of the Church) infinitely exceeds the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Ornaments of the Church
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:151523:140"/> are imbroider'd with Pearls and precious Stones; and ſo are the Chalices and Veſſels of precious Stones. The Candleſticks and the Lamps are of pure Gold. There are forty little Chappels, and as many Altars, upon which are put every day forty ſeveral Cloaths and Attires. The forepart of the great Altar is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of four Ranks of Jaſper Pillars, and one goes up to the Altar by ſeventeen Steps of Porphiry Stone. The Tabernacle is beautify'd with ſeveral Pillars of Agat, and divers curious Figures of Metal and Chryſtal. One can ſee nothing about the Tabernacle but Gold, Azur Stone, and other Stones ſo tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that through them the Sacrament (which is kept in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Veſſel) is eaſily perceiv'd. This Tabernacle is eſteem'd at a Million of Crowns. There are eight pair of Organs, the Chairs or Seats in the Quire are made of rare Wood, which comes from the <hi>Indies,</hi> curiouſly wrought after the pattern of thoſe of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> at <hi>Boulogne.</hi> The Cloyſters of the Monaſtery are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream fine; in the middle there's a Flower Garden, and a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which opens four ways, whoſe Roof is ſupported with Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiry Pillars, between which there are Niches, in which are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the four Evangeliſts with an Angel, and the ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made of white Marble bigger than Nature, who throw out Torrents of Water into Marble Baſins. The Chappel is arch'd with curious Architecture, and pav'd with black and white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There are divers Pictures of an ineſtimable value, and in the Chapter-Room, which is very large, there is beſides moſt excellent Pictures, two Baſs-Reliefs all of Agat, two foot and a half long, which cannot be valued. As to the Church, it has nothing extraordinary in its Structure; it is bigger than that of the Jeſuits in St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Street at <hi>Paris,</hi> but of the ſame form, except that like their Houſe, it is of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order. <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manto</hi> the famous <hi>Italian</hi> Architect, drew the Model and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it. The King and Queen's Appartments are not ſtately; but <hi>Philip</hi> II. intended this only for a Houſe of Prayer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, the Church and the Library were the things he took moſt care to adorn. <hi>Titian</hi> the famous Painter, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides, have exhauſted all their Art and Skill in curiouſly painting the Galleries of the Library, which indeed are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not only for the excellent Painting, but for a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Volumes that are there, without reckoning the Original Manuſcripts of ſeveral Fathers and Doctors of the Church, which are delicately bound and gilt. You'll eaſily gueſs at the bigneſs of the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> when I have told you that there are in it, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cloyſters, two and twenty Courts, eleven thouſand Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, above eight hundred Pillars, and an infinite number of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:151523:141"/> Parlours, Halls and Chambers. A little after the Death of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> II. there was taken from the Fryars of the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> a certain Eſtate in Lands (call'd <hi>Campillo</hi>) which the late King had given them; and was worth eighteen thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum,</hi> and this was done by virtue of a Clauſe in his Will, by which he revok'd all the immenſe Donations, which is his Life time he had given.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bragance</hi> being at Court in King <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's time, he had a mind they ſhould go with him to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> that he might ſee that ſtately Pile of Building. And as he that had the care of ſhewing it to him, told him, It was built in performance of a Vow which <hi>Philip</hi> II. made at the Battel of St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> the Duke reply'd, <hi>He that made ſo great a Vow, muſt needs have a great Terror upon him.</hi> And now in mentioning this King, I remember to have heard, that <hi>Charles</hi> V. recommended to him the preſervation of the three Keys of <hi>Spain.</hi> Theſe were, the <hi>Streights-mouth, Fluſhing</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Cadiz.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors</hi> have the firſt, the <hi>Dutch</hi> the ſecond, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the laſt, but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſoon recover'd it from them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eſcurial</hi> is built upon a deſcent of ſome Rocks in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and barren Place, and environ'd with Hills; the Village ſtands below it, and has but few Houſes in't; it's in a manner always cold Weather there. The extent of the Gardens and the Park is a prodigious thing to ſee, in which one meets with Woods, Plains, and a vaſt Houſe in the midſt, in which the Keepers lodge; it abounds with all ſorts of Deer and Fowl.</p>
               <p>After having ſeen a Place which ſo highly deſerves our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we all left it; and as we had viſited the Royal Houſes of <hi>Pardo</hi> and <hi>Carcuela,</hi> we return'd over the Mountains, which is a nearer way, but very troubleſome. We came by <hi>Colmenar,</hi> and coaſting along the little River of <hi>Guadarama,</hi> we paſt through <hi>Rozas</hi> and <hi>Aravac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where we learnt that the Queen's Houſhold were juſt going away to meet her upon the Frontier. We immediately went to the Palace to bid adiew to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and the other Ladies. The King had made them all be mounted, that he might ſee after what manner they would be on the day of her Entry; for this reaſon all the Gardens, and Doors every way were kept cloſe ſhut and guarded, and no Man was to enter there. The young Court Ladies lookt well enough, but good God! what figures were the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and <hi>Donna Maria d' Alarcon,</hi> who were the Governantes of the Queen's Maids; they rid every one upon a Mule ſhod with Silver, and all friz'd
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:151523:141"/> with a large houſing of black Velvet, like that the Phyſicians in <hi>Paris</hi> ride with upon their Horſes. Theſe Ladies, dreſt like Widdows, (which I have already deſcrib'd to you) very old and ugly, with moroſe and imperious Looks, wore broad Hats, ty'd with ſtrings under their Chins; and twenty Gentlemen which walkt a foot by their ſides, held them up, leſt they ſhould fall. They would never have ſuffer'd theſe Men to have touch'd them in that manner, had not they fear'd breaking their Necks. For you muſt know, dear Couſin, that though every Lady has two Gentlemen Uſhers, and that they go with them where ever they go, yet they never give them their Hand. They walk by their ſides, and preſent to them their Elbows wrapt in their Cloaks, which makes their Arms look monſtrous thick. The Ladies do not come near them; but that which is yet more ſtrange, if the Queen in walking ſhould happen to fall, unleſs her Ladies were near her to help her up, though there were an hundred Gentlemen there, ſhe muſt be pleas'd, either to riſe by her ſelf, or lie all day upon the Ground, for none dare take her up.</p>
               <p>We ſpent part of the Afternoon in looking at theſe Ladies; the Equipage they had was indeed very rich, but very poorly and dully contriv'd. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Terra Nova</hi> had alone, ſix Litters of Velvet of various colours, and all embroider'd, and forty Mules, whoſe houſſings were as coſtly as ever I ſaw any. You will not hear from me again, dear Couſin, before the Queen is come hither. While the King is gone to meet her, and the whole Court is abſent, my Kinſwoman will go into <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> about ſome buſineſs ſhe has there. I might ſend you a ſhort Relation of our little Journey, if I could be aſſur'd it would pleaſe you. I moſt heartily embrace you.</p>

               <p>THE whole Court is return'd, and in my Memoirs you'll find, dear Couſin, the particulars of the Queen's Journey. The King and ſhe were both together in one Coach, and the Curtains being all open, I ſaw her at her arrival here: She was dreſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:151523:142"/> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> way, and I did not think that ſhe lookt leſs hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in this, than in her <hi>French</hi> Garbe; but the King was dreſt <hi>a-la-Schomberg,</hi> which is the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> habit for the Country, and 'tis almoſt like the <hi>French.</hi> I have heard it told, how ſtrangely the Queen was ſurpris'd the firſt time ſhe had the Honour to ſee him; he had on a cloſe body'd Coat of grey <hi>Barragon,</hi> very ſhort and wide, Velvet Breeches, Stockings of <hi>Pelo,</hi> that is, raw Silk, which they work ſo very looſe, that their Skin appears through them; this Silk is as ſmall as a Hair, and though they be very ſtrait, yet the King pulls them on at once, and ſo he'll tear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twenty pair one after another. He had alſo a very fine Cravat, which the Queen ſent him, but it was ty'd a little too looſe: His Hair was put behind his Ears, and he wore a grey Hat. All the Journey, which was very long, they ſat cloſe to each other in a large Coach, and ſeldom could underſtand one another but by ſome certain ſigns, for the King cannot ſpeak a word of <hi>French,</hi> and the Queen could ſpeak but very little <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi> Upon their arrival at <hi>Madrid,</hi> they went to ſing <hi>Te Deum</hi> at our Lady <hi>d' Atocha,</hi> attended by all the Perſons of Quality, and a multitude of the People, that made the Air reſound with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Joy. Afterwards their Majeſties went to <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> becauſe the Appartments in the Palace were not yet ready, and that the Queen was not to remain there till ſhe had made her Entry. This time muſt needs have been very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to her, for ſhe ſaw no body but the <hi>Camerera Mayor</hi> and her Ladies. She's forc'd to lead a Life ſo much againſt her Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that ſhe has need of all that Diſcretion and Sweetneſs of Temper ſhe's poſſeſs'd of to be able to endure it. She has not ſo much as the Liberty to ſee the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador; to be ſhort, 'tis a perpetual Torment. All the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies love her dearly, and amongſt themſelves pitty her.</p>
               <p>I was ſometime ago at the Counteſs of <hi>Villambroſa</hi>'s, and in a great deal of Company. The Marchioneſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> came in there, and as they are extream ſuperſtitious in this Country, ſo ſhe told them, like one affrighted, that being with the Queen, who looking her ſelf in a great Glaſs, and laying her hand gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon't, it crackt from top to bottom; and that the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it without being in the leaſt mov'd, but even laught at the Conſternation that all the Ladies about here were in, telling them, it betray'd a weakneſs of Mind to take ſuch notice of things and Accidents as might proceed from natural Cauſes. They diſcours'd and argued a great while upon this matter, and with deep ſighs ſaid, that their Queen would not live long.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:151523:142"/> She alſo told us, that the <hi>Queen</hi> was much more diſturb'd at the incivility of the <hi>Camerera Mayor,</hi> who ſeeing ſome of her Hairs out of place on her Forehead, ſpit on her fingers to lay them ſmooth; upon which the <hi>Queen</hi> ſtay'd her Arm, telling her in a Majeſtick way, that the beſt Eſſence there, was not too good, and that taking her Handkerchief, ſhe was a great while a cleaning that part of her Hair which this piece of Antiquity had ſo unhandſomly wet. It is no uncommon thing here, to wet ones head all over, the better to ſmooth and make the Hair ſhine, the firſt time my Head was dreſt after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mode. one of my Relation's Women undertook this curious piece of work, ſhe was no leſs than three hours tugging and pulling my Head, and finding that my Hair, which is naturally curling, would not comply, without ſaying a word to me, ſhe dipt a great Spunge twice in a Baſon of Water, and baptiz'd me ſo handſomly, that I was laid up with a Cold for a Month.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Queen,</hi> it would draw pitty from one to ſee how this <hi>Camerera</hi> treats her; I am well aſſur'd, that ſhe neither ſuffers her to have ſo much as a ſingle Hair curl'd, nor to come near her Chamber Windows, nor to ſpeak to any body; and yet the <hi>King</hi> loves the <hi>Queen</hi> with all his Heart, and for the moſt part eats with her, and that without Ceremony; ſo that very often when the <hi>Maids of Honour</hi> are laying the Cloth, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> will divert themſelves in helping them, one will lay the Cloth, and t'other a Napkin: The <hi>Queen</hi> has her Meat dreſt after the <hi>French</hi> way, and the <hi>King</hi> his after the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi> He has a Woman Cook to dreſs all his Victuals, but the <hi>Queen</hi> endeavours to bring him to like the <hi>Ragous</hi> that are made for her, but he cannot abide them. But now you muſt not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin, that their <hi>Majeſties</hi> are ſurrounded with their <hi>Courtiers</hi> when they are at Dinner, at the moſt, there's only ſome <hi>Ladies</hi> of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> a few <hi>Menins,</hi> but a great many Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male <hi>Dwarfs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> made her Entry the 13th of <hi>January;</hi> after all the Paſſages and Avenues of the great Road which leads to <hi>Buen Retiro</hi> were ſtopt, and all Coaches forbid to come that way, there was a <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> built, and the <hi>Queen</hi> painted upon't. It was alſo cover'd with divers Garlands, and had ſeveral Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems and other things painted; it was ſet in the way by which the <hi>Queen</hi> muſt paſs to go into <hi>Madrid;</hi> on each ſide there was a ſort of a Gallery which had places contriv'd in them, to ſhew the Arms of the ſeveral Kingdoms under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion, joyning one to another, by certain Pillars which ſupported ſome gilt Statues, every one of which repreſented Crowns and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:151523:143"/> which had relation to thoſe Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>This Gallery reach'd to the Triumphal Gate on the great Road, which was very rich and adorn'd with ſeveral Statues; where likewiſe there were four beautiful and young Maids dreſt like <hi>Nymphs</hi> waiting for the Queen, and holding in their hands Baskets of Flowers, ready to ſtrow them on the Ground as ſhe paſt; hardly was one out of this Gate or Arch but a ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, and ſo for a great way one after another was ſeen. Theſe were adorn'd with the <hi>King's Council,</hi> that of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and other Places, under ſo many gilt Statues; that of Juſtice was higher rais'd then all the reſt. A little further was repreſented the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> accompany'd with the <hi>Law, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Protection</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Faith</hi> was exhibited in a Picture, <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> open'd the Gate, and <hi>Joy</hi> came forth to receive the new <hi>Queen.</hi> There was beſides, a Picture which ſhew'd the Reception <hi>Solomon</hi> gave the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and another where <hi>Deborah</hi> was giving of Laws to her People. There were alſo the Statues of <hi>Ceres, Aſtrea, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Vertue, Life, Safety, Time,</hi> the <hi>Earth, Tranquility, Peace, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Reſt Themis,</hi> and <hi>Liberality.</hi> Amongſt all the Paintings I took notice of, that where <hi>Aeneas</hi> is deſcending into Hell; <hi>Cerberus</hi> chain'd by the <hi>Sybile,</hi> the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> where <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes</hi> ſhew'd his Son who ſhould ſucceed him in his Poſterity. The reſt were fill'd with an infinite number of <hi>Hierogliphicks.</hi> The Queen ſtopt at the third Arch, which was over againſt a very fine <hi>Parterre</hi> in her way; in it were falls of Water, Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Fountains and white Marble Statues. Nothing could be more pleaſant than this Garden: It belong'd to the <hi>Fryars</hi> of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paulo,</hi> who built it. The fourth Gate was in the middle of the Place call'd <hi>Del Sol;</hi> it was not leſs glorious than the others by the Gold, Pictures, Statues and Motto's about it.</p>
               <p>The Street where the <hi>Furriers</hi> dwelt was all full of ſeeming A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, though their Skins was ſo artificially ſtufft, that any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would have taken them for liying Tygars, Lions, Bears, and Panthers. The fifth Gate, which was that of <hi>Guadalajara</hi> had its peculiar Ornaments, and after that, the <hi>Queen</hi> paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goldſmiths Street, the ſide of which, was ſet full of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of pure Silver, there were ſeen alſo divers Bucklers of Gold, upon which were contriv'd the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> Names with their Arms, in Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, Emraulds, and other Stones ſo fine and rich, that the Skilful ſaid, there was to the value of above twelve Millions. In the <hi>Placa Mayor</hi> there was an Amphitheater ſet full of Statues, and adorn'd with Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:151523:143"/> The laſt Gate was near that, in the middle of the firſt Front of the <hi>Queen</hi> Mothers Pallace, was ſeen <hi>Apollo,</hi> all the <hi>Muſes,</hi> the Picture of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> on Horſeback, and divers other things which I did not mind ſo much to give you an Account of them. The <hi>Pallace</hi> Court was ſurrounded with young Men and Maids, which repreſented all the Rivers both great and ſmall of <hi>Spain,</hi> they were Crowned with Reeds and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lillies, with Pots overturn'd, and the reſt of their Attire ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They complimented the <hi>Queen</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> there were alſo erected in this Court, two Caſtles of artificial Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. All the <hi>Pallace</hi> was hung with the richeſt Tapiſtry that belong'd to the Crown, and there are but few Places in the World where there is finer ſeen, two Chariots full of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> went before their Majeſties.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates of the City came out of their <hi>Publick</hi> Houſe in their Robes which were made of <hi>Brocado</hi> embroider'd with Gold; they wore little Hatts buttoned up with Plumes of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and were mounted upon very fine Horſes, they came to preſent the Keys of the City to the <hi>Queen</hi> and to receive her under a Canopy. The <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> Mother went in a Coach all open that the People might ſee them, as far as the Counteſs of <hi>Ognates</hi> Houſe, where the <hi>Queen</hi> came to them.</p>
               <p>Six Trumpeters in black and red Suites in company of the City Kettle Drums mounted upon fine Horſes, whoſe Houſings were of black Velvet, march'd before the <hi>Alcade</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Knights</hi> of the three <hi>Malitary</hi> Orders, namely, St. <hi>James, Calatrava,</hi> and <hi>Alcantara</hi> followed after in Cloaks all embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd with Gold, and their Hatts covered with Plumes of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; after them went the <hi>Tutulados De Caſtille,</hi> and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>King</hi>'s Houſhold, they wore white Robes, and moſt of them were <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> their Hatts were trim'd with Diamonds and Pearl, and their Magnificence appear'd every way; they had moſt admirable Horſes, every one had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Liveries, and their Footmens Suits were of Gold and Silver <hi>Brocado</hi> mixt with colour'd Silk, which lookt very well.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> rid upon a curious Horſe of <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> which the Marquis <hi>De Villa Mayna,</hi> her firſt Gentleman Uſher, led by the Reins, her Cloaths ware ſo richly embroider'd, that one could ſee no Stuff, ſhe wore a Hat trim'd with a Plume of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the Pearl call'd the <hi>Peregrina,</hi> which is as big as a ſmall Pear, and of an ineſtimable Value, her Hair hung looſe upon her Shoulders, and upon her Forehead, her neck was a little bare and ſhe wore a ſmall <hi>Fardingal,</hi> ſhe had upon her
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:151523:144"/> Finger the large Diamond of the <hi>King</hi>'s, which is pretended to be the faireſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> But the <hi>Queens</hi> pretty Looks and her Charms ſhin'd much brighter than all the ſparkling Jewels with which ſhe was adorn'd; behind her and without the Canopy, went the Dutcheſs <hi>De Terranova</hi> dreſt in <hi>Duenna</hi> together with <hi>Donna Laura Maria D' Alarcon</hi> Governante of the <hi>Queens</hi> Maids; they rid each of them upon a Mule. Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them the <hi>Queens</hi> Maids to the number of eight all cover'd with Diamonds and Embroidery, appear'd upon very fine Horſes, every one having two of the <hi>Court</hi> walking by their ſide; the <hi>Queens</hi> Coaches went after them, and the Guards of the <hi>Lancilla</hi> brought up the Rear. She ſtopt before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Ognate's</hi> Houſe, to ſalute the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> Mother; ſhe alighted at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> where Cardinal <hi>Portocarero</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Tolleda,</hi> waited for her, and immediately <hi>Te Deum</hi> began, as ſoon as it was ended, ſhe mounted her Horſe again, and rid to the <hi>Pallace,</hi> where ſhe was receiv'd by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> Mother, the <hi>King</hi> help't her off her Horſe, and the <hi>Queen</hi> Mother taking her by the Hand, led her to her Apartment, where all the Ladies were waiting for her, and fell on their Knees in all Humility to kiſs her Hand. While I am upon this Head of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> I ſhould tell you, Dear Couſin, that I have heard there are certain <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> eſtabliſht in the <hi>Pallace,</hi> which have been obſerved there for above theſe hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Years without the leaſt Devotion, they are call'd the <hi>Orders</hi> or <hi>Ceremonials</hi> of the <hi>Pallace;</hi> they run thus, That the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall go to Bed at Ten a Clock in Summer, and nine in Winter. At the <hi>Queens</hi> firſt being here, ſhe did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appointed Hour, it ſeemed to her Reaſonable that the Rule of going to Bed, ſhould be when one was ſleepy; but it frequently hapned, that as ſhe was eating her Supper, ſome of her Women, without ſaying a Word to her, would begin to undreſs her Head, and others to pull off her Shoes under the Table, and ſo hurry her to Bed with that haſte, as made her very much wonder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> ſleeps in one Apartment, and the <hi>Queen</hi> in another, but this loves his <hi>Queen</hi> too well to lie from her. It is thus noted in the <hi>Orders,</hi> That when the <hi>King</hi> comes out of his own Chamber in the Night to go into the <hi>Queens,</hi> He muſt wear his Shoes like Slippers, (for here they make none of theſe laſt,) his black Cloak upon his Shoulders inſtead of a Night-Gown, (of which no body makes uſe at <hi>Madrid</hi>) his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel,</hi> or Bucklar (of which I have ſpoken in ſome of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) faſtned under his Arm, and his Bottle faſtned by a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:151523:144"/> String to the other: But you muſt not think this Bottle holds drink to quench thirſt, it is for a quite contrary purpoſe, which you muſt gueſs. With all this Accoutrement, the King has beſides a long Rapier in one Hand, and a dark Lanthorn in t'other; and on this manner he is obliged to go all alone into the <hi>Queens</hi> Chamber.</p>
               <p>There's another Order in the Ceremonial, which is, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King has taken a <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> and happens to forſake her, ſhe muſt be a <hi>Nun,</hi> as I have already told you. I have heard that the late King being in Love with a Lady of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> he knockt one Night ſoftly at her Chamber Door, as ſhe imagin'd it was he, ſo ſhe would not open it, and only ſaid to him through the Door, <hi>Baya, Baya, con Dios, no quiero ſer Monja;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Go, go, God be with you, I have no mind to be a Nun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo ſet down, that the King every time he receives a Favour from his Miſtreſs muſt give her four <hi>Piſtols,</hi> you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he will not ruin his Eſtate thus, and that the Expence he is at for his Pleaſure is very moderate. To this purpoſe it is publickly known, that <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. the Father of the preſent King, having heard of the Beauty of a famous <hi>Courtezan,</hi> went to ſee her at her Houſe; but being a religious Obſerver of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> he gave her but four Piſtols, ſhe was very angry at ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate a Recompenſe to her Merit, but diſſembling her Diſpleaſure, ſhe dreſt her ſelf like a <hi>Cavallero</hi> and went to ſee the King, and after ſhe had made her ſelf known, and had had a moſt particular Audience of him, ſhe pull'd out a Purſe of four hundred <hi>Piſtols,</hi> and laid it up on the Table: <hi>It is thus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I pay my Miſtreſſes;</hi> ſo pretending that this time the King was her <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> ſeeing ſhe came in Man's Clothes to find him out.</p>
               <p>By theſe <hi>Ceremonials,</hi> the fixt Time of the King's going to any of his Houſes of Pleaſure is known, whether it be to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> to <hi>Aranjues,</hi> or to <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> ſo that without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Orders, all his Equipage is ſent away, and early in the Morning they go to awake him that he may riſe and put on thoſe Cloathes that are ſet down in the <hi>Orders</hi> according to the Seaſon, and after that he ſteps into his great Coach, and ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contentedly goes, where ſeveral Ages paſt it has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on.</p>
               <p>When the appointed time comes to return, though the King is never ſo well pleas'd where he is, yet he muſt go away, that he may not alter the Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>It is alſo known, when he is to go to <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Devotions, at that Time the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> comes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:151523:145"/>
               <p>Every <hi>Courtier,</hi> and even the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> are oblig'd when they go into the King's Chamber to put on certain little Lawn Cuffs, which they wear quite flat upon their ſleeves, there are Shops in the Guard-room, where the <hi>Lords</hi> hire them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them when they come out. In like manner all the Ladies are to wear <hi>Patins</hi> when they go into the <hi>Queens</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I think I have already told you that theſe are a kind of <hi>Sandals</hi> into which the Shoe is faſtned, and which raiſes them up very high, if they ſhould appear before the Queen without theſe <hi>Sandals,</hi> ſhe would take it very ill.</p>
               <p>The Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> have none but Widdows and Maids a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, the <hi>Pallace</hi> is ſo full of them, that one can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe through the Latices and in the Balconies. And here's one thing ſeems to me very ſingular, which is, That a Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be Married is allow'd to declare himſelf the <hi>Lover</hi> or <hi>Gallant</hi> of a <hi>Lady</hi> of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> and for her ſake to commit all the Follies and to ſpend all the Money he can, without being in the leaſt blam'd for it. One ſhall ſee theſe <hi>Gallants</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> and all the Ladies in the Windows, where 'tis their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Employment to diſcourſe with, and entertain one another by their Fingers: For you muſt know that <hi>their Hands</hi> ſpeak a Language that is perfectly intelligible; and as it might be gueſt at if it was always alike, and that the ſame Signs always meant the ſame things, ſo they agree with their <hi>Miſtreſſes</hi> upon certain private Signs and Actions, which no Body elſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands. This kind of <hi>Love</hi> is publick, a Man muſt be of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſort of Wit and Humour dextrouſly to manage theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and to be accepted by the Ladies, for they are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful delicate and nice, they do not talk like other People. In the <hi>Pallace</hi> there reigns a certain Genius and Strain of Wit, quite different from that in the City, and ſo peculiar, that one muſt learn it as they do an Art or a Trade. When the <hi>Queen</hi> goes abroad, all, or however the greateſt part of the <hi>Ladies</hi> go with her; then the <hi>Gallants,</hi> who are conſtantly upon the Watch, go a foot by their Coach ſides, that they may enjoy their Converſation. It is really good Sport to ſee how theſe poor Lovers dirty themſelves, for the Streets are horrid naſty; but then, the more dirty the more gallant. When the <hi>Queen</hi> returns home late, there are carried before the Coaches where her <hi>Ladies</hi> are, forty or fifty <hi>Flamboys</hi> of white Wax; and this ſometimes makes a very glorious Illumination; for there are ſeveral Coaches, and in every one divers <hi>Ladies,</hi> ſo that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, one may ſee a above a thouſand <hi>Flamboys,</hi> beſides thoſe the Queen has.</p>

               <p>When the Ladies of the <hi>Pallace</hi> are let Blood, the Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes a mighty care of the Ligature, Fillet, or any Cloth or Handkerchief upon which any of the Blood of the fair one is has fallen; for he never fails to make a rich Preſent of it to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellero</hi> that loves her, and this is lookt upon to be a worthy Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a Man to ruine himſelf to all intents; there have been ſome ſo extravagantly fooliſh, as to give the Chyrurgeon the greateſt part of their <hi>Plate;</hi> you muſt not fancy this is only a Spoon, a Fork, or a Knife, which may be the Stock of a great many we know; No, no, I aſſure you, this extends to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Three or four thouſand Crowns; and this is a Cuſtom ſo rooted amongſt them, that a Man had rather feed upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Radiſhes and Leeks all the Year long, than not to perform what he is oblig'd to do upon theſe ſort of Occaſions.</p>
               <p>Few of the Ladies of the Palace leave it without being very advantagiouſly married; there are alſo the Queens <hi>Menines,</hi> who are ſo very Young when they come to her, that ſhe has ſome not above ſix or ſeven Years old; theſe are Children of the higheſt Quality, I have ſeen ſome of them more beautiful than the <hi>God of Love</hi> himſelf was ever painted.</p>
               <p>On ſome ſolemn Days, when the Ladies of the <hi>Pallace</hi> go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or when the Queen gives Audicnce, every Lady has the Priviledge to place by her ſides two <hi>Cavelleros</hi> who put on their Hats before their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> although they be not <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> they are call'd <hi>Embevecidos,</hi> that is, <hi>Drunk with Love,</hi> and ſo tranſported with their Paſſion, and the Pleaſure of being near their <hi>Miſtreſſes,</hi> that they are uncapable of minding any thing elſe, they are permitted to be cover'd for the ſame Reaſon that mad Men are, who underſtand not their Obligation to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and good Manners; but yet to enjoy this Liberty, they muſt have leave from their Ladies, otherwiſe they dare not preſume to attempt it.</p>
               <p>There is no other Diverſion at Court than Plays; but during the Carnaval, they empty Eggs by a little hole in the Shell, and fill them full of ſweet ſcented Water, and then ſtop them up again with Wax, and when the King is at a Play, he throws theſe at every body, and every one in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſty throw them likewiſe at one another; this perfum'd Rain makes the Air very ſweet, but withal wets People pretty handſomly, and this is one of their greateſt Paſtime's, there's hardly any body at this ſeaſon but what carries a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of theſe Egg-ſhells, that are either fill'd with Orange-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or ſome other ſweet ſcented Water, and as they go along in their Coaches throw them in Folks Faces: At this time the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo pleaſe themſelves after their faſhion; for example,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:151523:146"/> they'll break off the neck of a Bottle, and tye the part that is within the Wicker, to the Tail of a Dog, and ſometimes you ſhall ſee above two thouſand run after him.</p>
               <p>The King's Dwarf is the prettieſt that ever I ſaw, his Name is <hi>Loviſillo;</hi> he was born in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he is extream little, and exactly well proportion'd; he has a handſome Face, an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Complexion, and not only wittier than one can imagine, but withal very wiſe and knowing. When he goes to take the Air, there's a Groom to wait on him, who rides upon one Horſe, and carries another before him, which is ſo very ſmall, that he may properly be term'd a <hi>Dwarf</hi> Horſe, and is as handſome for his kind as his Maſter is for his. This Horſe is brought to the Place where <hi>Loviſillo</hi> is to mount him, for he would be almoſt tyr'd if he was to walk ſo far; and it is really a great pleaſure to ſee the Dexterity of this little Animal and his Maſter, when he orders him like a manag'd Horſe. I do aſſure you that when he is upon his Back, they do not both make above three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an Ell in height. He ſaid very ſeriouſly t'other day, that he would fight the Bull at the firſt <hi>Bull-Feaſt,</hi> for the ſake of his Miſtreſs <hi>Donna Elvire.</hi> This is a little Girl about ſeven or eight years of Age, but wonderful beautiful. The Queen commanded him to be her Gallant. It is a great Happineſs for this Child that ſhe is fallen into the Queen's hands. I'll tell you how it happen'd.</p>
               <p>The Fathers of Mercy went to redeem a certain number of Slaves which they brought to <hi>Madrid:</hi> and according to their Cuſtom of coming through the City in Proceſſion, the Queen chanced to caſt her Eyes upon a Captive Woman which led two little Girls by the hand; they ſeem'd to be Siſters, but there was this difference between them, that one was extream handſome, and the other as ugly. The Queen made her come to her, and ask'd her if ſhe was the Mother of thoſe two Children; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe was Mother only to the ugly one. And how came you by the other, ſaid the Queen? Madam, reply'd the Woman, we were in a Veſſel in which there was a great Lady big with Child, but we did not know who ſhe was, only by her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and the Richneſs of her Cloaths, it was eaſie to think ſhe muſt be of Quality. After a long and ſharp fight, we were taken, the greateſt part of her People were kill'd; and ſhe was ſo frighted, that ſhe fell in Travail, and as ſoon as ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, dy'd. I was by her, and ſeeing this poor little Creature without a Nurſe, and ready to periſh, I reſolv'd to nouriſh it up with my own, if 'twas poſſible. As ſoon as the <hi>Corſaires</hi> were Maſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs of our Ship, they divided the booty amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:151523:146"/> they were in two Veſſels, and ſo each took away with them the Lot that was fallen to them. Thoſe remaining Women, and other Servants which belong'd to this Lady were on one ſide of the Veſſel, and I on the other; ſo that, Madam, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd the Woman, I was never able to learn what or who the Perſon was, whoſe Child I ſaved. I now look upon her as my own Daughter, and ſhe believes I am her Mother. So charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Deed, ſays the Queen, ſhall not go unrewarded; I ſhall take care of you, and the little <hi>Incognito</hi> I will keep. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Queen loves it ſo extreamly, that the Girl always wears very rich Cloaths. She follows her Majeſty every where, and talks to her with that grace and freedom as ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares her to be of no mean Original. Perhaps time my diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver who ſhe is.</p>
               <p>Here are none of thoſe ſolemn and pleaſant Feſtivals which are at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> when the Ladies have the Honour to eat with their Majeſties. All is very reſerv'd in this Court, and in my Opinion, nothing but a general and conſtant habit could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent abundance of things from being extream tedious to them. Thoſe Ladies which do not actually dwell at Court, never come to it, but when the Queen ſends for them, and ſhe is not allow'd to ſend for them often neither. She lives for the moſt part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Company than her Women, there was never any Life more melancholy than hers.</p>
               <p>When ſhe goes a hunting, (and you muſt know, that of all the Queens that have reign'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhe's the firſt that has had this Liberty,) and is come to the place appointed for mounting on Horſeback, ſhe muſt ſet her feet upon the Coach boot, and ſo throw her ſelf upon her Horſe. It is not long ſince ſhe had one, that being a little ſhy and skittiſh, would ſtart away as ſhe leapt upon him, and ſo ſhe had a moſt grievous fall. When the King is there, he aſſiſts her, but no body elſe dare come ſo near the Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> as to touch them and help them on Horſeback; they had rather they ſhould be hurt, and that their Lives ſhould be expos'd to the greateſt danger.</p>
               <p>She has fourteen Matreſſes or Quilts upon her Bed; there's neither Flocks nor Feather-beds us'd here, theſe <hi>Quilts</hi> being made of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, which is the fineſt in the World; they are not above three fingers thick, ſo that her Bed is no higher than one of ours in <hi>France.</hi> They make theſe Matreſſes ſo thin that they may the more eaſily be turn'd and remov'd; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have obſerv'd that they keep hollower, and are not near ſo hard.</p>
               <p>It is the Cuſtom in <hi>Madrid,</hi> for the Maſter or Miſtreſſes of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:151523:147"/> the Houſe to go before thoſe that come to ſee them; they think this is a piece of great Civility, to leave, ſay they, a Perſon in the poſſeſſion of all that is in the Room. As to the Women they do not kiſs one another in their Salutation, they only preſent their hand without Glove.</p>
               <p>They have another Cuſtom, which I think odd and peculiar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and that is, when a Daughter has a mind to be marry'd, and is the eldeſt, and has already made her choice, though both her Father and Mother are againſt the Match, ſhe need only go to the Curate of the Pariſh and tell him the Matter, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is done. Immediately he takes her from her Parents Houſe, and either puts her into a Convent, or to ſome devout Lady, where ſhe remains for a little time; afterwards, if ſhe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres in her Reſolution, the Father and Mother are obliged to give her a Portion ſuitable to her Quality and their Eſtate, and in ſpight of them ſhe is marry'd. Partly upon this Account it is, that ſuch care is taken to keep their Daughters cloſe, and to let no body ſpeak to them, and ſo to make it difficult for them to take any meaſures for the management of an Intreague. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, provided the <hi>Cavallero</hi> be a Gentleman, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and he may marry his Miſtreſs, though ſhe ſhould prove to be the Daughter of a <hi>Grandee</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since my being in this Country, I think I have not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed informing you of every thing; I will now proceed to finiſh my Memoirs of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing thoſe I firſt ſent you pleaſe you ſo well. I ſhall ſend you the reſt as faſt as any thing happens and offers it ſelf, that is worth your Curioſity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I do alſo promiſe you to write you that Relation you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of me. But for all theſe little Trifles, I muſt beg you, dear Couſin, to grant me ſomething that is conſiderable, and that is, the Continuation of your Friendſhip, for which I have a juſt value.</p>
